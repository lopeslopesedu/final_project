For what? A couple hundred bucks?	I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
How about it?	I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Now, or he dies, please.	Come on, Alice.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.	I know who you are.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?	It's good what you're doing.
Come on, where?	Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.	What?
Oh, but I just told you. --	-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Did you buy the horse, papa?	Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
You hear that?	The sound again?
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-	I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
No. Bob did.	Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?	It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.	Yes, Leslie!
Come where?	My office.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -	Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.	No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...	We can't wait to be sure.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!	Y... yes. I guess I did.
I probably got the same thing as you.	I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?	Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.	In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.	You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?	Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Oh.	You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Yesterday.	Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Oh?	Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Do I look crazy?	Yes!
If you want... I can take you back to town now.	I ain't in a hurry.
Oh.	But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?	Anthony, I'm petrified.
I got us through the War all right.	And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.	Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!	Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Because I want to get married.	Why?!
What?	Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?	Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Well, I'll get it from the safe.	I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.	What do you want with us?
What about what that guy said?	Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!	Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.	They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.	Like this.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...	Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Get out of here, Jack!	David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.	How many people were in your old school?
...But?	Didn't you visit the campus?
...I heard different, thought that was...	...not that time...
Cadet, what's your name!	Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?	He's fine. We'll come right over.
Those are my breasts.	Can I feel 'em?
Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.	No need. I'll call again.
Privately owned by ...	Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
We do.	For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
It's fun.	I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Yes, what about him?	He's here.
"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it."	I don't know.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?	According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?	Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
What's the other thing you're scared of?	Carnies.
Maybe it's just the light.	Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
That's nice.	You and...Luis?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.	You're really something, ace.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?	Sure, anything you want.
A dressing bag?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.	Why don't they come to me?
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...	Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
What is it?	Nothin'.
Yes, I'm right?	Right.
What do you mean?	Nothing.
It's Perry!	Perry?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.	How long would you need me?
He's doing his best.	I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.	That's fine.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --	I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Is that your final answer?	Yeah.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.	Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Coffee?	No. I'm okay.
He knows what he's doing.	If he won't cooperate?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.	It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.	Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...	You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
I'll see you there.	What are you talking about?
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.	And Vera niece, too.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?	No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What did he say?	David says Jack comes to warn him.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.	What?
I saw it.	Saw what?
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.	Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!	Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.	I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Adam!!	Where?!
It's Halfdan the Black!	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.	Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
It was at least as good as the sky.	Really?  Okay!
In your operation.	I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?	Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.	I'm glad I met you.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!	Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.	Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?	Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
You did.	You drive away business roarin' in like that.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?	Frank would open you.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?	Next life.  Oh, what's that?
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.	How did you land that?
Yes, yes he did.	You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
I used to play ball.	Yeah?
Yes - sure	Yeah - sure!
Too old.	But if you could?
Really?	Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
"It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand ""ants""?"	Yes.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.	She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.	Oh, Stanzi.
This night is too beautiful to have again.	I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Yes, for both.	I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.	Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
I don't know.	What was her name?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.	She's got my word.
What was that, Doolittle?	Negative effect.
All right.	So, what are you seeing?
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?	Yes, Talby, what is it?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?	The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?	Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.	You can't go now.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.	You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Yeah... guess so.	Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
...Milo?	Hmm?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.	Were you adopted, Bob?
Frank Abolofia.	The Wolf?
What happened?	I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.	Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.	I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
No.	No what?
Five thousand dollars.	No.
He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?	Dr. Tyrell?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.	Anything.
What is it?!	You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
With, like, images?	Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.	HEY!
You brought the money?	Right here.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?	Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Goddamn it Stephen!	-- I told you to stay next to me!
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?	I beg your pardon?
It makes me sad.	Can --?
What work?	A Mass for the dead.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!	Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.	What do you mean?
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.	Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!	No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Elaine, what happened to us?	Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
The next corner we can get a cab.	I should be committed.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.	What do you mean?
Who asked you?	If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?	Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.	Let him patch up his own breeches...
Why did you park way back there?	Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.	Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
The zoo? Is he rational?	Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.	Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.	Who with?
What'd she die of?	She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Oh, okay, can I call?	Okay, yeah, call.
What?	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Austin, I'm coming with you.	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!	Don't talk nonsense.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.	Sorry.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.	You have a helluva way of asking for help.
But we made a deal.	Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No! I won't have him back.	But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?	You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?	You told it to me.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.	Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.	No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I'm afraid I don't...	This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
My name's Clementine, by the way.	I'm Joel.
David, what are you doing?	Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Don't think that'd be wise.	I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I got seven thousand.	I got three.
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -	But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Are you using minoxidil?	No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Noooooooooooooo!	Where did you learn to shoot?
...Ma???	Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
This is fun.	All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?	I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"	Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
What is it my son?	It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
I hope I'm not being too forward.	Not at all.
I'm ready to make you another deal.	Ooh, be still, my heart.
I guess not.	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.	You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You said 48 hours!	I never agreed to that.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.	Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.	So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Pick a song, Hawk.	Got any KISS?
You better get packed.	Right.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.	I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Dorothy Vallens?	Yes.
Not particularly.	And your lady?
The elevator broke.	Where's Applejack?
That's okay, ROK.	Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.	You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.	I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
HE'S GONE!	When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
How do you do?	I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.	Yeah.  I've noticed.
You bet!	So, did you buy a movie?
Jim...	Three...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?	Yes -- why?
Still nothing from the colony?	Dead on all channels.
That just doesn't make any sense.	I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around...
Then who --	-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.	You don't?
You don't wanna move, do you?	I can paint anywhere.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.	Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.	Animals?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --	Hey, Joel --
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.	Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.	I don't get it.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...	What did you find?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.	Don't care.
This is so patronizing.	Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?	Yeah. What?
You better pray, gal. You better pray...	Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --	A bad idea.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.	Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Bob.	I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
Who is... we?	You'll know soon enough.
Jim was old enough...	He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
What do I get?	You get half mine and I get half yours.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...	Just get back here!
Arson.	Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
And then?	"It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: ""Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."
I love you Don with all my heart.	No, it's not Don.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?	Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.	So I did! And what was so important about it?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?	Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --	And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.	Roger.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?	Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!	Nothing. Go ahead.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.	"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Where the hell were you?	I had you covered.  From back there.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.	Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.	Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.	I was doing my job.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!	You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
I'm not a stalker.	You know Wilmont?
Let's talk about it later.	No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Did you do any of that?	No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.	Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.	Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?	Yeah. Cool.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.	We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
You got a machine on it yet?	We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!	I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!	Well, we did in my family!
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?	It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Why you got me chained?	Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.	I prefered the terrorists.
Hello...	Jack! It's Jani.
I'm so sorry, honey...	Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?	Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Today is bath day.	Sorry?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.	YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
He's here.	Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
Honey. What were you doing with that?	I... I don't remember.
Haven't you forgotten something?	I don't think so.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-	You're at Paul Owen s.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.	Yes.
That's scary sounding.	Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --	We're not going anywhere.
No shit.	You think Jack shot him?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.	When will he be home, Major?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.	You think I'm improving?
Request; life support systems check.	Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Anything ---	It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?	He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?	You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
What is this place?	The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.	Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
I know.	You're a policeman.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.	The coward!
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...	Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Father...	Take a letter...
Hello.	I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.	Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
You with Mother or Father?	Both, actually.
Where was it parked?	Right here.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?	Your cousins go out with him.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?	Because he's dying.
That feels so great.	Good...
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?	Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
The weed.	But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
I certainly do!	Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Vanish into thin air?	He hasn't.
What did she want?	Who?
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.	Okay then... let's get ya started.
He could?	His company made us.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --	Bullshit!
Look, you can have my wallet...	It's not nearly enough, punk.
My husband is with me, too.	He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?	Why would I tell Mom?
...Like love...	Exactly.
The Judgment is ours!	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.	Fred.
An evil petting zoo?	You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
No...	You're his sister, right?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.	Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.	That bruise has cleared up nicely.
You mean we'd be dead?	No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?	How do you figure?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.	My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?	...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.	Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
So how was school today?	It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.	Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...	Hello...
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!	Good idea!
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.	Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Oh, Miss Price?	Yes, Doctor?
I'm afraid I am.	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
That's terrible.	"Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, ""Your Grampa is going to die."" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead."
I'm in heaven, Lt.	Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
That son of a bitch.	That'd be my reaction too --
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?	No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Can you put men at all four?	No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.	She's right?!
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?	Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
But chickens?	Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
So -- which Dakota you from?	North, actually.  How'd you   ?
No dogs, huh? Okay.	And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.	Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.	Got any ideas, little brother?
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.	You are a head case.  Have a donut.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!	Blow out the candles!
You trust this Moonan guy?	I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.	You're kidding.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -	If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it.
Manages what?	His escape.
Hello...	My name is...
Of course not.	I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!	Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
If that's what you think is necessary.	But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
It's moving.	It's circling us.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.	San is an honorable title.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?	Where is escort service?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.	What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Oh no...	He just lost his temper a little.
What else?	Are you trying to rap to me?
Feeling better?	No.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?	Not particularly.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.	Doolittle...
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?	Never mind how I found you.
That was a test?	Take a deep breath.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.	Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Pike never confessed.	We've been making progress, I see.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!	To get some frozen poultry.
Can she I.D. them?	They were wearing masks.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.	I think he's already feeling better.
Bob. I didn't...	Swear.
Jesse, we're outlaws.	And we're good at it.
So?	So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Really.	True story.
Fuck you Vincenzo.	Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
No.	No what?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.	She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Yeah, I know.	Would you like a piece of cake?
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.	You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
You don't like it?	I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.	So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --	-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
No.	Say something dear.
Did I say something?	No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?	I just turned twenty.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.	Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.	Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Yeah.	I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.	Something stupid.
How old are you, Senor Colon?	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.	They've gotta be joking.
He said what?	"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
My apartment.	I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.	All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
You mean she's not coming back?	You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.	There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
I don't know...	I want his name.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...	Why do you think he did it?
Where is he?	We're too late. Take a look.
Will you please talk to me?	Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
No? Was Mozart a good man?	God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.	Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
What?! What are you doin'?	I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.	You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Oh, Matt . . .	Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?	I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Parts of it.	Which parts?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.	No, I do.
I don't think we should meet again.	It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...	Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
Toss you for it.	I don't gamble.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.	Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Could be.	Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.	What the hell are you talking about?
What you see is what I got, mister.	You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Soon as I finish the job.	When might that be?
Pop, for Christ's sake!	You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
It's gone.	I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?	My undying love.  Have some.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...	Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
John... Merrick	"Say ""Merrick""."
Em iram! Em iram!	No, I'm not playing this game.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.	Now wait...
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --	Theoretically.
Okay?	I'm fine. I'm
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?	That's true.
Alice!	I've got to go.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.	Think it'll work?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.	It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
I remember that speech really well.	I had you pegged, didn't I?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?	Parts of it.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.	A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
I'm sorry about what I said.	Said what?
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.	You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
They wanted a girl.	Nobody ever wants me!
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.	Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I promise. Is that all?	One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Where'd she go?	She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
No.	See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Who the fuck is doing this?	After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.	Do you know what this is?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.	David?
Mr. Dickson?	Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...	You went berserk...
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.	So I bring some cheese?
I was doing my job.	"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"
Have you got your passport?	What?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.	Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?	What about me?
Uh huh.	Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
A Fed? Is he close?	I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?	Don't you remember?
I just walked in.	Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...	Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
Don't you know?	No.
What for?	I have to take the car.
It's in the driveway.	Temporarily.
A cheap hotel.	What are you coming here to do?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.	Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
That just might work.	Maybe, maybe...
You mean somebody asked?	Only the right people can have you, Curly.
Goodbye.	You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!	I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
No... How?	The Telegraph office.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.	Well, she isn't just any woman.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.	"No mo' ""city slickers.""  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?"
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.	Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.	Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Love...	... death ...
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.	You called me Jeffrey.
Who?	Halfdan the Black.
To bed?	Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""	Well, they aren't.
Are you an expert in amnesia?	Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --	Eventual supernova.
Are you for real?	Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Don't mess with me. How much?	Five bills.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.	Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.	Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Yes, I considered it.	Did you ever turn tricks before?
How you erase this?	I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
How long you had these guys?	Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
How did you guess?	You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Are ya ready?	Aye.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?	No.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.	Oh, yeah?
Yeah?	Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
I want to speak with you.	Go away, unless you got my money.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.	Credit?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?	Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!	Sir August...?  What now?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.	Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.	What point is that?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?	Shallow? I'm shallow?!
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.	Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
That's right?	I've never met anyone like you in my life.
That would knock my father out.	Yeah?
Do you have a Salon Prive?	We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Good luck, Austin.	Thank you.
Whoa... she is a killer.	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Airport Ho-Jo!	I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
What's your name, Giant?	Karl.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.	We can do that.
I've got lots of time.	So do I.
I just wanted --	What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
You need money again?	No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
All the same, you must name an amount.	It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Heck, no!  What?!	Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.	Then he didn't send you?
Of course! You want out?	Yes.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Let's go.	Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Did you see that?	Yeah, I saw it.
No. No one that I know of.	I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...	Jack, wait...
Male or female?	Female.
Why?	We're not sure.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.	They saved your ass, convict.
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...	Hmmm ...
In a second.	Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
You bloody...	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.	You're Polish?
You love him?	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.	What was he after?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?	Once, maybe.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.	Yeah? Have a brandy?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.	You're kidding. He's so... big.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?	No.
Why not?	You'd think I was mad.
They're not gonna send you right back.	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
May I please be excused?	Uh...yeah.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.	You don't wanna move, do you?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?	You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
Oh, um...	Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?	Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.	Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Thanks.	"Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming ""Mother Machree."""
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.	Is that all there is?
He said what?	He said you ran away from home.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.	Or sometimes not at all.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.	You tellin' the truth.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.	Ah. Italian?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!	Wolfi! Your father is dead.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.	Shut up and go home, will you?
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
Thank God.	Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
"He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: ""24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!"" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters."	Fan out and look for them.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.	I don't think you will.
I haven't had fun like that since college.	I'm sorry.
This town sucks.	"Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with ""Home Made Cooking"", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong."
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.	Really.
Why?	It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
No, my friend knows her.	She Chicano, yes?
"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."	I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Look.	No.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?	"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.	Where is Mrs. Brown?
You goin' to the escort service?	You got any better ideas?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...	If God exists?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.	Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
You know that guy?	From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?	Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.	Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?	Where?
Around...	...too early...
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.	It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Yeah...	I'll get him for you, Nick.
What?	You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!	God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
Bah!!	THEN IT'S WAR!
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?	Yes.
I'm okay.	Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Where?	We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.	There can be no excuse for tardiness.
What's he doin'?	I think he's talking to it.
It's just not.	Why not, you stupid bastard?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...	What's wrong?
Well no -- not exactly -- but --	Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
Let her go!  Let her go!!	If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Why's that?	Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.	Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
That's Jellybean!	FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
What other job you got?	Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.	Who are you revolting against?
Why?	We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.	Okay.
Are you cold?	Yes.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?	Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.	Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.	Jesus Christ.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.	What here?
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.	I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
...Benedict Arnold...	...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
You're a liar.	You know I'm not.
Yeah?	Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Eddie.	Yeah, who's this?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.	How big is it?
Who use to own it?	Russia.
Okay.	See you later.  Good luck.
You pick it.	You just say. I'm not really --
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Your father?	I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
... It's Harcourt.	Harcourt is dead.
The frogmen?	With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.	Would you go up, please?
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!	So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?	I couldn't find any razor blades.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Just better.	Beautiful.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!	So you believe me?
What's that?	That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.	Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
To make me wretched in two weeks.	To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...	Five this week; how many the week before?
No.	I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
What?	Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?	Go ahead.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.	Why you?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.	Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?	Okay, okay.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?	Keep going...
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.	You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Wolfi!	What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.	What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.	Robbery's not criminal?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.	The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.	You don't know how to hotwire.
Where's our friend?	He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?	No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.	You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?	I don't remember.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --	I do!
What? The tapes?	Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.	Really?
"I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't ""Tina,"" it's Seiko."	Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
Don't know if God wanna see me.	He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Why don t you just go for Price?	Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
I'm not hungry.	Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Jeffrey? What's going on?	Shhh. I'll tell you.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.	Not at all.
You don't believe him?	It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Probably.	This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Be careful.	I will, don't worry.
Elaine.	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.	I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?	Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
I'm amused.	Don't be.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.	The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
No ma! No!	BLAME...
How 'bout we check with Eve first?	You bet!
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.	That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.	Dorsia is...fine.
No.	Yes.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!	Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?	That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
The Children. Where are your children	Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!	Are you French?
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?	Vodka!
Thanks for calling.	Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?	Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
The faggot speaks.	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.	I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
"OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the ""yellow man"". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."	Wow. Should you tell my father?
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.	What?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.	What point?
Pike and I got separated --	Yeah and he doesn't know when --
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.	You're such a retard!
And what can he do for you?	Can the maker repair what he makes?
Thank you. Cream?	No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Not an easy day to forget.	No.
So... you just moved here?	Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
So you don't mind?	I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.	I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I can handle it.	I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
-- car keys?	-- my coat -- but we should --
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.	What do you get out of it?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.	This all looks wonderful.
He's not ready yet.	When?
How would you know?	Hey, two days with him is enough.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.	You fancy him.
You what?	It was fifteen minutes late.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.	Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.	Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.	So let's go. This place creeps me out.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?	What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
Yes...he's my friend.	Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..	"Whereas ""Wet 'n' Wild"" is an emotional journey. ""Tied and Tethered"". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina."
You can't just walk in, either.	They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.	I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
You're shaking. What is it?	Tension. It'll go.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.	Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.	Oh yeah...?  Alright.
It's been six years.	What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Does Bella come here?	That bitch? No.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.	Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.	Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
What don't you know?	This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There are reasons for the way we do things here.	Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Hey, two days with him is enough.	That's no bull.
"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."	And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
What's the matter with you?	Tell them to go!
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.	Why the gun?
Never read a book in my whole life.	Maybe you need to start.
I told you I can't, not yet.	You don't have any other choice.
How much?	I think two million.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.	They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.	Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
That's not what I hear.	What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.	No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!	I had to see you. I'm getting married.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.	I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.	You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.	Can you put men at all four?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.	What is it?
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
So...you hang out here a lot?	Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.
Shall I answer it?	No! No, it's him!
Well, I think --	No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
I can't believe you said that.	What did I say?
No.	Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?	Yes.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?	Yes.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.	Both of you.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --	-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.	All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.	Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.	Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
You said you could help.	I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
Why?	Well, I think --
What's gone?	The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Fred.	Wha?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?	Who cares. Don't bother me.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.	Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
... What's going on?	Just do it, Amy, please, go.
What is it now?	Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
What can we do to assist you?	Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
No.  They all do.	I never know anymore.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.	How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.	Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.	Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...	Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?	I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?	No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.	I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.	Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.	You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Talk to me, Hudson.	Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!	I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Sparkling rocks?	Little ones.
Yeah.	But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Lawford?	Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .	Then where were you?
Where am I?	You're in a hospital in London.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.	You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.	But if we have not caught Wallace --
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.	Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Hello, Exposition.	Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
I need your help, Joyce.	Where's Ich?
You really think he'll remember you?	No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!	Be quiet.  Watch.
What?!	Wanna be a part of history?
Detonation in twenty minutes.	Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
What else?	What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
I must... consult with my father.	And I will consult with mine.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?	Pardon me?
...the pipe tobacco.	Yes, sir.  Is that all?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?	My wife?  She worries about me.
Of course.	Do you believe I love you?
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!	Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Okay, okay, okay--	"Say the words, ""I understand."""
I did. Are you?	Yes.
No.	Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
I think I should go back.	Joel, come here. Please.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.	It is a big deal.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!	She's the winner and we're going to state.
Dad!	What?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?	Says who?
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.	Is it that bad?
The best.	Does it eat?
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...	...like macaroni and cheese...
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.	All right, let's go.
What'd she say?	That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.	Weird...
What's the matter with you?	What's the matter with you?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!	Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Twenty-five.	Where are your parents?
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.	Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?	No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
I heard that.	What was it?
Dead.	Oh.
Why?	Because we're going there.
Which is?	That it wasn't an accident.
A franc for your thoughts.	In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!	Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What do I have to do?	Just play a part. A little acting.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...	You -- covered in my vomit.
How big a package we talking about?	This by this...
What?	Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Father, will you please explain what's going on?	The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.	East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
My father is a genius.	No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...	Save it, I already took the tour.
Yeah.	OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?	I'm so hungry.
What, Sebastian?	You're androids.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.	Good! How is the patient?
Right.	You can see why it's sensitive?
"It means, ""Never without my permission""."	That's what I thought.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.	In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Like one of Mom's?	Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.	And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Yes you!	This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?	Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.	And?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....	So?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.	Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I say, do what you wanna do.	Funny, you're the only one
...We're coming in.	He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
I see.	Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;	Silence!
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?	Not like that.
I understand.	Here it is.
But I like the presidential suite.	Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You won't be long?	I'll join you shortly.
Thousands.	Why?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.	Call off your watch-dogs you said.
But -	You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.	Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Leaving what?	This.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Chut up!	Go back to China, bitch!
I'm afraid he's been stalling.	That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Yes.	Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?	Yeah, like that.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?	Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.	"Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, ""Come and get it,"" bitch!"
Nick!	A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Does that work?	Yeah...Seems to.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.	I quit two days ago, Brian.
I'm trying to quit.	I've got news for you. It's not working.
Mrs. Christian.	What?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.	It's registered in my mother's name.
You knew me as a kid.	Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
I feel much better. Thank you.	Are you comfortable here?
Maybe you need to start.	Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?	Why?
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.	No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
I... What can we do?	I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.	When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?	She needed it.
How did you know my father?	This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?	Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.	Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Whaddya mean, buy?	Pros.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.	Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
How be dat?	I don't know who I am.
You read my mind.	Put your pilot on.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.	I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.	Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.	Hold on, Alice.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.	Where?
Thank you.	I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?	Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Did you kill Yankees?	A fair number, Ma.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?	This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Yes.	I've got to go, now.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.	No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Can the maker repair what he makes?	Would you like to be modified?
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.	What'll we do?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...	Is that written in his shoe?
I am always receptive to suggestions.	Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.	Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.	That's why you're a gambling man.
That's good. Keep it at forty.	Did we get it?
Whose death?	It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.	So you decided to go to America.
Fine. How'd it go out here?	We're gonna have to talk...
I'm touched.	You fucked us over.
Jack, are you really dead?	What do you think?
Thanks.	Uh, what's next?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.	Is he oily or dry?
Good day to you, young sir.	Good morning.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.	Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Can I help you?	I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.	Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.	I got him.  Don't get pinned.
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...	So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
He'll tell me when he gets home.	That'll be a test, won't it?
Any ideas about the colour?	Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --	You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--	Straight.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...	I apologize for the inconvenience.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.	Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Is that good or bad?	It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!	Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
A fair number, Ma.	Say your prayers?
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.	Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.	I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?	Yeah.  I guess.
Key? Key? What is the key?	No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...	And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
I put them on together.	I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!	...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?	Sure.  Go left.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.	See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
You don't seem too happy about it.	Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.	Please do.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.	Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Anything?	No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.	When will this happen?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.	You must have a visa or something...
A traveler, eh?	You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
I like my horizons narrow.	Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.	Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.	Of course not.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.	You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.	Old fool!
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?	I did.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.	Your mother's not dead.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --	But -
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.	I have to go, Julian.
How did you get in?	The stairs from the street.
Why can't we agree on this?	Because you're making decisions for me.
Confutatis Maledictis.	We ended in F Major?
He told you and you let him do it.	He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.	You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?	Yeah, swell.
Yes.	How is Central these days?
I scoured the city for it.	I love it!
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.	My loyalty was never to my country.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.	All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
No, she's fine.	I'm so relieved.
What do you mean?	He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!	Rae!
Come on, you can trust me. Please.	You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.	Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?	Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.	Habib?
Yes, of course, we --	-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Help me move him.	Careful. Check his pulse.
Latitude 47 degrees.	Wait a second. He knows I know.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.	Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?	Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh no, I can't do it.	You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.	We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Madame.	This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.	Yes.
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...	Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah? What's his name?	Victor Laszlo.
Oh, boy! A jacket!	Your mom made that all by herself.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Debbie.	My Debbie?
You weren't supposed to see that.	They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
"""Make"" him?"	You know what I mean.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.	I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...	I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Baseball?	I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
We need more bars!	This is -- what?
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?	We don't need to know.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?	Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?	Out where?
Sure have.	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I was doing it for them.	BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
What the hell are you doing here?	I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.	I love you, Vanessa.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?	Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Still need a lift?	Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?	That's it!
That's illegal, you know.	I know.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.	But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.	It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Then who wins?	You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.	Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.	It does me good to see you.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.	Well?
If I say no?	You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
I don't know... I don't remember.	Something must've happened! What set him off?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.	Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.	I expected no less, Captain.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.	That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.	He didn't recognize me.
Well, what do you think?	I think...it...works.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.	Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
What's he saying?	He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.	Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
So what are you thinkin' here?	Really want to know?
Am I bothering you?	No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
It's a plain end, see? So?	Take it off.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.	Sure you did.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.	My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?	For a man in my position --
Is it fresh?	It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
He had a yacht?	No, he just hung out there.
Regret.	What else makes you feel regret?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.	I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.	Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Test of manhood.	You win.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.	Here's your money.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.	Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.	We all played the field.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.	It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.	Thanks a lot, Mom.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?	Wonderful!
How'd it go?	Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!	The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.	Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!	Em iram! Em iram!
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?	Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
I'm okay, Matt.	You've got enough?
Mr. John Steed, please.	I'm afraid that's impossible.
...delusions and paranoia.	I was all of these.
She needed it.	A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.	Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Bullshit.	I'm telling you...
What?	I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
He's not bad at it.	It's tougher than it looks.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.	That's what you think.
Yes.	Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
I don't have a girlfriend.	My point exactly.
Can I use the car tonight?	Of course, Jeffrey.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.	You think of everything, don't you?
We all set?	Hang on a second.
I got what I paid for.	You didn't mind too much.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --	-- Thank you.
The fuck you laughin' at?	You don't got half what Tehronne got.
I came to find my grandfather.	I have to go...
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.	We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
I don't know what to say.	Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
Where are we going?	We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Chief says...	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
My brother blacksmiths!	That's right.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?	Were you in Cluett's apartment?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?	No.
Did you know your mother better?	She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...	Ronnie. Please, baby...
If God intends you to go, then you will go.	Damn God!
Yeah. You know...hang out.	Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
I've come to dinnnnnner!	Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.	Does he know that?
Who?	Joey.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.	Jim was old enough...
Austin, may I have a word with you?	Of course, luv.
-- What are you doing here?	I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Our expenses?	Uh huh.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?	Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?	You're the best, Maxie.
Well, don't worry about it.	And don't you worry about it.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.	Is that all?
I'm so very sad.	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.	Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...	Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
What happened to Bella?	I'll tell you later.
He's fine. We'll come right over.	Shall I send a car?
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.	"But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918."
No, but I'm the best.	A little modesty would suit you better.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?	No.
"Whereas ""Wet 'n' Wild"" is an emotional journey. ""Tied and Tethered"". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina."	Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Watch me.	Good luck, since I got the keys.
That's because most of it never happened.	But it's romantic.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.	Yeah.
Good day to you, M'Lords.	You mock us with a smile?
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...	I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Go ahead.	You have great tits.
I want his name.	I told you, I don't know.
Firehouse.	Cute.
Epilepsy.	Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.	I must only let the red rage...
Where is Jesse James?	This here is the Younger Gang!
Front. Use your teeth.	Sorry. Old habits.
I don't want to know.	It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.	Why do they have to die for me?
MOMMY!	Mommy's here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?	Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
I have no proof that it was false data.	You have no proof that it was correct data.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...	What?
I can't find the second one, sir.	Look under the body.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.	Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?	She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
That's a wolf's head.	Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.	And you have this letter of intent?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.	Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...	Back at The Fishbowl?
I let her take a shower.	A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.	I'm not scared.
Miss Price.	Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.	Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
I know.	So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
"Relax, that's my ma's code for, ""Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."""	No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Something.	Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.	I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.	Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Want to come out?	You're English.
If that's the way you want it.	That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.	Absolutely not.
A cop?	I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Oh, Stanzi.	I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?	I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.	Yes, of course, we --
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...	I did.
Frank would open you.	Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...	All of them created by people like me.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.	I will if you shut your piehole.
It's so small.	What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.	My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it	Why not?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.	That was war.
What, Howard?	We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?	That does not compute.
You shot Childs and Nunez.	They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.	Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
High spirits, desire, commitment.	You'll take care of that.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.	Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I'm so tired...	You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Shall I send a car?	No, a cab will be faster.
Why?	Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.	Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
A long time.	Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.	We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?	That's not a spear. It's a pike.
...perfect...	That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.	"This is our first ""date"" date."
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.	She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
Yeah? When was the last time?	In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Anthony, I --	And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Did you grow up around here?	No. She was an immigrant.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.	What are you talking about?
So we go to the bar.	I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
And?	And what?
We cannot defeat this --	With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Fear ...	... love ...
All right. As what?	I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?	I think so.
Aren't you even curious?	Engine 115, right?
What happens to Dunbar now?	Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
I thought ten years.	Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
I'm not so sure about this.	They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
"Are we on ""Cops?"" Are we on ""Cops?"" Are we on ""Cops?"""	Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Is that what you think?	Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
*What* will be okay?	We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Where is he? Where is Rob?	I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Who are you calling?	Mrs. Christian.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!	Where's your gun?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?	What?
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.	Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?	Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Oh.	Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.	Look at that.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22	I don't follow.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.	That's it.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.	Like a painting?
Bathroom.	Lovely.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.	I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
Guess what I'm wearing.	I don't know. Panties and --
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.	My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
And the putty around the door?	Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Ready for number three?	Let's go.
Where are you going?	I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
He drank it hot?	Yeah.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.	I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Well - what is he now?	He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?	It looks that way, doesn't it?
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?	Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
My tap shoes.	EUREKA!!
"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain."	What if you stay this time?
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.	Sweetie, we called the company.
Why?	Why what?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...	Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
What do you want?	You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
They're what?	She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.	You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
God, you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.	Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Lighten up.	But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.	Nice signal, dickwad!
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .	What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Beeeee careful.	Come on Dorothy.
Rick, I want to talk to you.	Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
You know him?	Heard of him.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?	You mean a woman?
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.	Oh no...
What?	He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
I snuck into #21.	Why would you do a thing like --
Well, yes, I admit it is.	Would you tell me why?
How?	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Sorry. You've lost me...	I'm asking what you're here for.
Oh God... what did we do?	Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I liked being with you last night.	Same here.
Are you stupid or what?	What?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.	But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
How could I not?	It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Come on in!	It's locked.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.	I had a good time last night. I really did.
How is bank?	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
-- I told you to stay next to me!	-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Who's they?	My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?	I don't want you to forgive me.
Hmm?	I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.	Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...	Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Tell him about me, Shadow?	Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.	Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
It's locked.	No, it's not.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.	Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.	You like everybody, Ronald.
There's no call for that kind of language.	Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
I suppose the idea was specialized training.	I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Everybody's rich.	He's good-looking.
I'm sorry.	Why?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.	Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...	What is this person's story here?
Who?	Paul Owen.
Helen!	Yes?
Of course.	Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.	No way to start a partnership.
Your doctor?	Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Rolfe.	Wade?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --	Leave Stephen out of this --
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --	Dignan, I --
Bob, where you going?	I'm not playing any more golf.
It's called Black Leather.	Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
I gotta work with these women.	Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Ch...	To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You're hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.	Incredible.
...yes she did.	...I heard different, thought that was...
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.	Not a big music fan, eh?
Is he in?	I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!	This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.	And just what is the game?
You can stay tonight.	I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.	It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.	I need you to stake me.
You've been having strange sex...!	No, Brett, I...
Take care.	Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
What's he in for?	He stole a tractor.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Two weeks.	Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Not yet.	Oh my God. Is her son OK?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.	I can't go all the way down south.
I can see why you liked her.	That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.	C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!	"Get this ""us"" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself."
know, but	Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
You mean in Turkey?	Exactly.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --	Wait --
What?	Stand up.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!	Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Easy Sketchy.	No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.	And...?
Well, I don't think I can remember it.	If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.	You still doin' it too fast!
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.	What else?
Right.	They're mutated sea bass.
Frank. Come in.	Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.	Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Negroes would be in an uproar.	So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.	Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Why not?	I asked for a policeman.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.	This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
And keep your sword greased.	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?	Firehouse.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?	Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
...the big apple, New York, New York.	To come back to our roots.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.	Alright...
Bye, Joel.	I love you.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.	What about your family, Donnie?
Yes.	You feel?
Campari and soda would do nicely.	Sorry, love.
LAZ, I said let...!	You better pray, gal. You better pray...
I don't know.	Did you tell Alice?
Because you tell Mom everything.	No I don't.  She worries about you.
Okay, #2.	Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...	No, don't say anything else!
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.	I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
See, I knew you'd be mad.	Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.	Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.	Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?	I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
No. No thank you.	It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
"Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called ""motive"" and you just gave yourself one."	You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.	Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?	Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
How are you feeling today?	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Don't this place look like home?	It look nicer then home!
It was bad.	Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Sure.	Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...	Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.	I know.
Someone stole my backpack.	Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.	Answer it.
How did they get away?	They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --	Abbott?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.	This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...	Dad?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.	All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
You look... better.	Just better.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--	No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.	I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?	This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh no, I couldn't.	It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.	You're forgetting who's in charge --
Go to sleep, Charlie.	You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I want your best man on this!	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
I couldn't cut the rope.	Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
"How should I know? ""Solving a problem,"" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there."	Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
What happens if I want to sneeze?	You won't. Not without permission.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...	I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.	Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Where did Paul hang out?	Hang...out?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?	Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
What?	A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.	Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
The prom?  Kat has a date?	No, but
I was afraid you weren't coming.	"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?	Where are you going?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?	No.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?	"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?"
Web's dead.	I reckoned.
...Do I?	Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.	What?  It doesn't work that way.
King ain't gonna like this.	Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!	WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Late?	Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.	No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
I'm marrying Debbie.	Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Yes, well, it's all good fun.	I liked the horse.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.	No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.	Eve? I'm leaving.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.	Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
The bedroom.	There is only one bed.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?	No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.	Sorry.
Sounds respectable.	Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Tell me.	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Oddly enough, I do.	Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.	Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
How's that? He works for Gillette.	We pay better.
So they caught up with you, too?	At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.	But how, sir?
You don't own this man!	I want him back!
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.	I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Well, what do you think?	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?	Yes...
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.	Yeah.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.	I've got a girlfriend, remember?
You're playing games.	Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.	Is the social studies class over for today?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there	... What's going on?
Of course.	You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
My goodness.	It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.	So do I.
Which I didn't have.	And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
So?	So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.	Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Yes, I know.	You probably also know that we found them okay.
What're you talkin' about?	I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.	I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Shoot.	How old are you?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --	Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
You didn't become crazy.	Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Syevodnya	Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
I got married.	I thought you might have.
Shit.	What?  What, that guy?
I'll send a cop back for you.	Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
It's just...	Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.	Yeah, I know.
You first.	Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You're going to be over the limit.	Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
That was quick.	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Weather's turning nasty.	You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Ah, Christ	You knew Sergeant West?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.	That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
You're not using it today?	It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Then what?	She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?	No.
Doolittle...	Yes.
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
No. What is happening?	Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.	Sir, let those laugh that win.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.	I can handle it.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.	What if you change your mind?
Who's Jacob?	My baby!
Longshanks promised!	You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.	These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.	Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...	Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.	That just doesn't make any sense.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.	And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.	Do you have a ticket?
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!	Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.	It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.	Leave me alone, Bob.
I don't have nothing.	Well what have you got?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.	What?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.	Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Look, I don't know what you want--	I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Right.	I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Righteousness...	Righteousness for his namesake.
Yeah.	Where'd you get the blood?
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.	What are my choices?
I don't think you're gonna make it.	Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.	Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yes, Doolittle.	Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.	Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?	Shoot.
Guilt?	If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?	See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.	And she bought that?
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?	We all came from Africa, supposedly.
The locks?	To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?	No, more of an acquaintance.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.	You can't cheat an honest man.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.	How much?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.	MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
I poisoned his life.	But not his body.
"""What do we tell him about the guns and money?"""	"""We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."""
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!	So you do know her.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.	I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Know where I can find her?	You don't want to.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.	Maybe after the holidays then.
Where's the restroom?	What?
How did you get here?	We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
That's your dog.	It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.	There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Yes.	Right. Okay. Good.
I am so sorry.	Why do they call you Frank?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.	Of what? They're both crooks.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.	Yeah?
May I be quite frank with you?	Yes, of course.
Hello.	Nice to see you.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.	What else do you think about during school?
I guess it lacks a certain style.	Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
You have to do something for me first.	You have a request?
Give me another.	Sacha, she's had enough.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.	How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Hey Murphy?	Aye.
Oh, thank you.	The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
It's okay.	Yeah?
Turn that fucking thing off!	I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Well, he...	I want to hear everything he said.
Then why did you quit?	I wanted to be a good one.
The Telegraph office.	But we were so careful.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.	If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
I think we might of scared her.	Let's just go.
You're interfaced with our dish.	Gimme the coordinates?
I'll call tomorrow.	Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.	But then how can you...
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.	I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.	What do you need?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?	If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.	Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Hello.	This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.	Right.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!	OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
You need to go.	Probably tonight.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.	Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?	Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --	Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.	It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?	It was a long time ago.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.	I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
What?	I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"	Sort of, um...
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.	I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
That's not true.	There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
No kidding?	I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?	Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
A girl.	Your basic hodge-podge.
On your sleeve.	Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.	You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.	Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
Of St. Louis?	Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
I don't remember saying yes.	I don't remember you saying no.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.	It wasn't very good last night, was it?
David!	What?!
I planned on catching him, Captain.	How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
You borrowed money from your mother?	Yes!
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.	We might need some mo' money behind this.
I'm sure, I said.	But you weren't. I could tell.
Who is he?	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.	Just like on TV.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.	Yes, it's coming along very well.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.	Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?	I'm sorry.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.	I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Why?	Just look. Little pocket.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?	If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
She's around. Always is.	I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Show me.	Here?
Yeah. It's pretty good.	It's like we've finally arrived.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?	Why don't you two stick to reality.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?	Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.	Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.	Good. Then have a drink.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.	Well, they're all excellent reasons.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.	Bene.
Both of us ride home with Best here.	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
You called it in?	I'm sorry.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?	I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
What'chu sayin'?	She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Oh hello.	You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.	"Relax, that's my ma's code for, ""Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."""
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!	It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
I remember.  You just left...	I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
How many of them did he kill?	Two.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?	Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
You're better than I expected.	I was at Harrow ...
I don't understand. What about you?	I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.	Jack?
You here to write my life story?	Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.	Interesting theory.
I'll see ya around, huh?	It's a small town.
So you have your small victory, now what?	A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.	Thank you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.	Your clothing reeks of it.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Hello...	Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.	Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?	Yes.
The standard ten.	Ten percent. Of how much?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.	Yeah.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.	Whom did they choose?
Stay where you are.	Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..	"""..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."""
Don't we?	No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
About Freddy?	What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
You want some coffee?	Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.	Specialty product.
A wife.  She left.	I'm sorry.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.	I don't know about that.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?	I wanted to see you.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.	Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
You're ruthless.	You're not so bad yourself.
Your life flashing before your eyes?	Just the last three weeks.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.	Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.	Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I'm trying to tell you.	Alright.  Go ahead.
How's Austin?	He's asleep.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?	Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.	But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.	Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
It is your corrupt we claim.	It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.	That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
Yes!	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
And I thought you were a bright woman.	Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.	Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!	David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
How does that feel?	It feels good.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.	My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
What happened with Rick?	We'll discuss it later.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.	...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Yeah.	Wilmont. Near the high school.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.	Then it must be Wednesday.
Which one?	All 900.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.	Dr. Evil?
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.	I can't do it, Jani.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?	Never. Why do you ask?
For how long?	Well, that depends...
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?	"All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the ""life's too short"" category."
Is he oily or dry?	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Can you help me get her back?	Look, I'd really like to...
May I finish?	Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
Sounds like a game show host to me.	No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
To bed.	To bed?
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.	No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?	By name only.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?	Where was Marcus?
He has a computer?	Sure.
What is this?	Those are her belongings.
It will be okay.	*What* will be okay?
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?	Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.	Right... Think it over.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.	I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Officer, I killed those people last night.	You did, did you?
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.	I'm like a joke to them.
What...No! Put it in the carton.	Sorry.
That would have made an impression.	I figure.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?	Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Where?	In the cash register. Step away from the door.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?	Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...	Shut it. It's Ma.
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.
May I wash you?	Groovy.
Hookers beat you up?	Yes.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!	Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yeah?  What kind?	Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
It's on the tenth floor.	What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
Thank you.	And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Roger.	Huh?
Stop the car.	Why?
Who?	The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
That's great. I -- didn't know.	She saved my life.
You just said	You need money to take a girl out
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?	Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.	Why?
She's a jerk.	You're talking about the woman I love.
Dino...	Nobody knows anything.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?	Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.	Our entertainment is enough.
Do you have something against science?	Not if it works.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.	Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.	Are we here?
You're English.	Of course! You want out?
We haven't checked.	Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...	Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.	Oh, Excellency, would you?
Good...	Um... that's very relaxing.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.	Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Say it	What?
You just feel sorry for me.	Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Don't think I won't.	Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Yeah?	Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.	Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
I'm going to check on him.	I need to lie down for a bit.
High five.	Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?	My best friend. My very best friend.
Yes, very pleasant.	Well, shall we go through Documentation?
What's that, a gram?	New card. What do you think?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.	First visit to London?
Has he sent the challenge yet?	Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
You mean a safecracker?	Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What'll I do with this card?	You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
The hospital?	Of course! What did you think?
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.	He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
Yes.	I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Who's that?	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
Excellency, may I present my niece.	Go ahead.
That's not mine.	One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.	You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Says you were a bully...	A bully? Moi?
You're in a hurry.	Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Alright.	Alright?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.	I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
We spent it!	Ha. Ha.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.	My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.	You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!	They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Why 're you doing this?	I told you
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.	Who is this... ?
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.	The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.	I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.	Yeah.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?	I do. God's truth. I do.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.	Dark Valdez.
Well of course I exist.	But how do you know you exist?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.	Yes, ma'am.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...	I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.	And they are?
That's enough!	Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Bob, rip up some bandages.	Pass me some whisky.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.	But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
My husband is a very courageous man.	Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.	We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Two more.	Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
What's that got to do with it?	When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
Shut up.	Does it hurt?
No.	Okay we won't talk about it.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.	You mean...
I have to go, Julian.	Why? Why do you have to go?
How much could you grow? Realistically.	As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.	Roger.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!	Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.	Why would you care?
What on earth?	Any ideas?
"Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was ""in your blood"". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... ""Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."""	Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.	Right, that checks out here.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.	Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Yes?	Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...	I said... STOP!
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.	Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
I don't want to use it.	Well, then cut it in half.
How old are your kids?	My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
We're moving you tomorrow.	But I like the presidential suite.
What are you talking about, Bob?	Can you use a coaster.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?	Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Please excuse this interruption.	Oh, brother...
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.	You think I'm fake.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!	The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Yes, sir.	Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?	No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.	How about chargin' the battery?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.	That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Tell me something true.	I hate peas.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.	Frankly that's how I remember it.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?	Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.	You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...	You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.	You'll be my first.
It's okay, just leave it.	I can get it. I can just...
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.	Right. Just a sec.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?	I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.	What happened to them?
Tom...	It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
Yes, Mum.	And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.	I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!	Nick...
You what?	When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!	Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
What do I have to do?	Some tap dancing, some singing.
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --	Tell me what I can do.
He needs to hire an attorney.	No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.	There's only one I want.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...	Who is he, his name?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
"""My dear President""..."	"That doesn't sound right...  take out ""President""...  now read it."
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.	Oh, naw. Hi.
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.	Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.	How long have I been on Gateway station?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.	Sheep don't count.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.	...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
No.  No way.	But it's...
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.	In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.	He will come back.
You got to be kidding me.	I'm not kidding.
It wasn't what I wanted.	So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.	I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.	Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!	Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...	So did your father...
No dances, just tell me.	The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
Elaine.	Te...!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.	You don't know Halfdan the Black.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --	Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Ann Arbor?	My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Buy it from me?	Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?	Sir, yes, sir!
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?	No.
Why's that?	Because you're... different.
And...	Bond... James Bond.
Majesty!	Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?	What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Can you put that in a bag or something?	You get it when I get her.
Really! Is it serious?	No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
How could you not *care* about the movie?	You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
How's it going?	Maybe I'm going too fast.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --	-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
No.	I want to be near you!
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.	I don't know about that plantation angle.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.	After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.	We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!	This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Yes, he's fine.	Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
How old are you?	Thirty-five.
Dorsia's nice.	Nice?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?	Yes, but...
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?	Pirate -- no question.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?	Who?
I need you on my side.	I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
No... Jason... please...	I was here!
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.	I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.	Thank you... very much.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?	I'm glad you do.
That sounds good.	Two.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?	Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Herr Salieri.	Yes, I am looking after him.
How did you get this gig?	My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!	Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Who is this.	You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?	Jeffrey.
Hi. How are you feeling?	I was dreaming.
I thought it was appropiate.	Is that good or bad?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --	Strategically.
The fax machines.	No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
The recovery is very impressive.	The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
How long have I been on Gateway station?	Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --	Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?	Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.	True.
How do you say nineteen?	Dies y nueve.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!	I think you're right.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...	Well?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?	Yeah, boss?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?	No! I just wanted
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?	Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No wonder you're so popular.	No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.	Yeah?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...	Yeah...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...	I thought you got rid of...
Maybe it's the satellite.	Let's try #2.
I don't know. These things take time.	How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --	You have to stop this!
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?	We sure did.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.	Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.	Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.	So what's up with you?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.	Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
But they'd still get the idea, right?	You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.	Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.	I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that	Yes, I know that.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.	WHAT  ?
Boss!	Yeah?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?	This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Yes	Why? Do you enjoy it?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.	Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.	I'm telling Mom.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
In there.	Show me.
What crap?	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.	What's suck night?
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...	Rule of thumb?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?	Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.
Let's go niggers!	Louder.  They can't hear you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.	Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
There you go.  Love you.	Me too.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.	He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
That's unique.	Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?	Enough!
Shit. I knew you were crazy.	I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Your help.	I already don't like the sound of this.
And you were a sympathetic ear.	Exactly.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.	You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Only you and the photo lab.	You're all through with this now?
Alright, Tom.	What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
What's a long time?	Ten years.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.	As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.	We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?	...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Do too much, I'll die.	Do too little you'll die.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.	At church?
No, John, not one that I can see.	Then I shouldn't change anything?
We've done all our talking, Wade.	It's just...
Jesus, Bob.	I didn't do anything.
What?	I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.	Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.	We can't let him get away.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.	Zack... He made it... He's alive...
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?	Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Well, he killed my partner!	He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...	Thank you, Trubshaw ...
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?	I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.	Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.	That's what I would have done.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.	Fuck you, Clementine.
Please. Go. Just go.	I'll...
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!	Why?
Where are we headed?	You say...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!	It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!	What's gone?
You're not trying to run away?	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.	How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
How you doing, sweetie?	Been better, Dad... You?
Did everyone call everyone?	They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.	That's never been one of my problems.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.	Did he say who?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.	Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
They all like this in your family, father?	She's an exception..
Look under the body.	Got it.
He wants a lot of money.	I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.	But how come I'd be there?
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.	That's mighty black of you.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --	-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?	It's lonely in there, in my room.
Take it. damn it!	Okay.
Te...!	That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?	It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Why?	We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You wanna knock of f?	No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.	Your mess.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?	Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Never	Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.	We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?	Those are my breasts.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.	Why are you so anxious?
Cool ropes.	I braided them.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.	What's the capitol?
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --	I wanted to come here.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.	We do not want your tired and sick.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!	Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
What?	His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Just want to say good luck.	Break a leg.
So, what do you do?	What do you think I do?
It's okay. Really.	Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Yeah?	Hey bud! Finger here.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...	I don't like watching anyone be sick.
How's the food?	Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.	How the hell do you know that?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?	Maybe.
Wait. Did he see us?	We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
A Turkish brothel.	Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Save it, I already took the tour.	You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!	I understand.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.	You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
"Freeze! No ""worm-boy"". No ""Mr. Worm,"" and no ""Worm-Master-General!"" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?"	Deal. Now read me something.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.	Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?	Ss'kya'ta'.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.	You can always he thinner. Look...better.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.	Hello summer detention.
Sonofabitch!	Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
Of what sort?	You are a private investigator?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.	That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
I don't want to.	Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.	So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!	I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?	Well... no...
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.	But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.	Pumpkin?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?	Get away, Snorri.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.	Mutants?!
The good stuff.	I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Here in Vienna.	Then you must know this.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.	I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?	I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.	How long's this been going on, Muddy?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --	Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.	What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.	You bring the cigarettes?
But --	It was my master Keitel's idea.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.	Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.	She doesn't want me around
No.	Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Did you talk to him?	Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?	To find out who killed my husband.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.	Alice...
Hi!	Yes?
Very.	C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
He's been full of vinegar lately.	He's planning a job.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.	Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Yeah, but.	Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Mutants?!	It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.	I'd love that.
This ain't gonna work.	Rae...
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.	You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.	Wonder where we'll be then.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?	Touch of the flu.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.	I'll tell him when he comes in.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.	Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?	Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!	It's me.
Well, not exactly.	You been with a girl ever?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.	"""During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium""."
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	Yes.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.	I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.	Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
This is the group I was telling you about.	Which one is your brother?
Why are you doing all this for me?	Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.	You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?	He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
No.	You should be.
How many points you got left on your license?	Uh... at least fifty.
You know where the chemicals are?	I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Am I not welcome?	Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Yes. But that's a different...	No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.	Oh, yes. Thank you.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.	You did.
And all these rooms here?	Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?	What?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.	Who?
He was your friend.	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Last February?	Mmm.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?	I'll be right back.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!	Milos.  Get my money!
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.	All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.	I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
What was that about?	Nothing.
We won, Austin.	Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.	Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..	How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I was misinformed.	Huh!
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.	Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.	I don't want to live anymore.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?	It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.	My son?
Huh?	What time did Matt Brown get in?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?	See, we're getting along famously!
Three more hours...	Where is he?
No. I'm okay.	Perrier? San Pellegrino?
I'm ignoring you.	Pull out, goddamnit!
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.	Well, we can.
No. She was an immigrant.	What's an immigrant?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.	They're running the rest of me next month.
There'll be a time.	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes.	I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Open it!	Have you no fear of God?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...	Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.	Any planets?
Yeah.	What would your girlfriend think of that?
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.	What is your uncle's name?
What for?	You know what for.
How did he look?	What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.	If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
What is it?	Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
That's not the way to get ahead in life.	Yes.
Someone attacked him.	Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.	My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.	That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Well... I'm game.	Me too.
...wanna savor this.	It's gonna get cold.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.	Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
You're completely demented.	See you next week!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...	Yeah, you betcha...
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.	We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?	Tell me.
Probably a touch of what's going around.	I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.	Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.	And Bourne? Where's he now?
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.	Yeah -- we'll see.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?	Thank you.
Mmmerrick.	"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
Yes, they are.	Look at the treads on those.
How long have you been awake?	Three days.
Uh... Everything okay?	Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?	Consigned to flames of woe.
It's the truth.	Without hope there's no point to anything.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.	Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Let go!	You set me up.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.	A naked woman, chained in ya house?
No I don't.	I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
He came from Paris with Rick.	Rick? Who's he?
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?	Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.	That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
My pleasure.	It was at least as good as the sky.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.	Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?	Naomi.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.	Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Nuthin' I can't handle.	The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.	Does he always leave so early?
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
Can't complain.	We got a lot to talk about.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.	You didn't
OK. Mark that down.	I did.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.	Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?	Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
You have... you have a husband.	I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.	What of it?
Joel? It's Joel, right?	Yes?
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.	Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
You know Knowlton pretty well?	Yeah...
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?	Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Milo. What's up?	Well -- you sent for me.
We can't do this.	No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
What's wrong?	I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.	I'm not moody.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway	You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
We're missing all the fun...	What's it all about?
"""Burma run"" because you fly over Burma..."	*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?	Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!	Kristen's story really got to her.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --	I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.	You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Does that help?	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
I believe he is probably lying.	Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
I beg your pardon?	"""Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James."" Only a dime in the hotel lobby."
I was getting to it.	Getting to what?
Not if you remember my dad.	Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.	Yes, Sir!
Rules are made to be broken.	People, too.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.	Alexander Pope?
He was my partner.	They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.	Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --	Jesus!
That's what I'm talking about.	I'm down!
Drafted by the Red Sox.	You played for the Sox?
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.	Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Yes.	Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Gary, you're quite an animal.	Screw you...
Did you hurt her?	You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Your 'out.'  This came for you.	My father!  He's not - ?
Rules are made to be broken.	If you say so.
You're back.	You look great.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.	I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?	It's going back down.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.	Finland.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?	Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?	Everything is quite all right.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Need some help?	You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Hello, Rick.	Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
So what are you going to do?	I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Now, you will receive us.	We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
My Mom and Dad.	Very funny, smart ass.
Dignan, it's --	Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I thought you might have.	I would never --
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.	*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.
Snuff films.	I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Not that I've seen.	Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.	The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
"""The fifth one this week""!"	Oh, for goodness' sake!
Why not?	Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.	That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.	Don't tell him you're here.
What -- rape?	No. It isn't rape then, is it?
What reason?	Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.	What's that?
Oh?	I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?	Okay!  Damn!
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.	Have you taken leave of your senses?
You owe me three-fifty.	Really.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.	But he's all right?
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.	Roger.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.	You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.	Last week? When?
Move him.	Why?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.	Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
This thing solid?	An elephant couldn't crack it.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.	Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Will you let me look?	My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?	We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
No.	Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.	Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.	What will I say when she comes to the door?
Quite a collection.	If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.	...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.	I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
No.	I thought not.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.	Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
You're lying --	Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!	What are you talking about?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!	Come where?
"""You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."	Good on ya, man.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.	Have you ever made love, Donald?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.	But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
You think this is the guy who did it?	We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
You shut up now, boy.	No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.	Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Grandma Death.	You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
And what do you think Mendez?	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Thank you.	Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.	Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Doolittle, hello?	Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Nothing.	You no-good pup!
We're under attack.	Where's my family?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.	I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--	How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Are you sure?	You saw the ad in the Times?
Cold.	Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -	Please! Just one moment.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?	Blow me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!	I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?	Eh? In here!
What if I don't want it?	Tough.
Yes -- why?	I wanna powder my nose...
Get outta here!	What the hell happened?
I've got to write some of this down.	That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Do you have to be so brutal?	Yes
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?	I want another shot, Sir.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.	Can you help me get her back?
I want to hear it.	I've got a job.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --	Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?	Yeah.
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.	A born freak can only go uphill.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.	I wish it were that easy...
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!	How many points you got left on your license?
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.	No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You called the casino a cesspit.	Well it is. But I know where I am.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.	But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
A job?	Yes, the money is good.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.	If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
It's time somebody ate *them*.	I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
We are both from Prague.	How long are you planning to stay?
I'll match any man with the sword.	But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?	Yes.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --	Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.	Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!	Rogers Hornsby?!?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.	Please.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
The duck?	Hearsay.
Yes.	Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.	God's permission? God doesn't...
Strange.	You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.	Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --	Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?	They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
First visit to London?	No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Shut your mouth and drive!	Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
He used to puke in his sleep.	Bastard.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!	No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.	No.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.	Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?	"""King Kong"". It's really good."
Thanks for the invite.	Got anything to drink in there?
Would that I could say the Same.	Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.	The Lifeline is divided that way.
I have no idea.	Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Longitude 109 --	Wait... He knows.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.	Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Oh, for goodness' sake!	And I thought you said it was something special...
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -	Yes?
Oh!	Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.	Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...	Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
He sure loves to stay awake.	That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.	'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
In a harem.	What's that?
I have a job.	This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.	I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Yes, Hal, what's up?	It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Otherwise known as an orgy?	"It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --	I burned the Christmas tree.
It won't.	But if it does.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.	Dunwitty, don't leave.
Why don't you come with us.	OK.
You have a request?	Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Would someone please come over here and...	Fuck!
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -	He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?	Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.	They're dead.
What're you -- what?	It was a hate crime.
Oh huh	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
Well, we can.	So let me see it. Where is it?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.	Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.	What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Yeah.	Say hi to Naomi.
Got in a little accident.	Yeah.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?	I was kidding. People actually live there?
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --	Yes.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.	No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.	I promise. Is that all?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --	Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
They probably want to find out when they were made.	Right.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!	Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
What's up?	Holden got hit.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.	Who can we trust?
What the fuck... !	I promised him to Machine.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --	Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
"""A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."""	It is a nice piece of writing.
We blew the Horn Resounding.	SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?	Yes.
Think it'll work?	Nah.
Darn it!	Um... can dad come this time?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.	Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Clockworks.	Clockworks?
You think Jack shot him?	Well, it was an accident.
For what?	No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
Hi.	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.	Her name is Gretchen.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!	I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
Ms. Kruczynski?	Hi.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.	Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Nice doggie. Good boy.	Walk away, Jack.
I want a job, Giles.	All right. As what?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.	Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.	Milo, you --
Pike never confessed.	No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Speak up. Come on.	Al.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.	Sure.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.	You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.	You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
I don't need one.	You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!	Set!
Show me again...	Okay...
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.	Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?	Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
A leader, like Laszlo?	Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.	And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Go where?	On a ride.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.	Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
What's this?	Got me.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.	Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I'm coming with you.	Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.	Decontamination -- ?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?	I promise.
Marg!	That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.	Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
Reef!	So they caught up with you, too?
Yeah?	Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Almost all of them.	The recovery is very impressive.
Uh-huh?	Take your second position.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?	You tell me.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.	Machine.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.	What?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?	No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
The car for Debbie?	I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Please, it really doesn't matter.	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.	Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Ellen.	Don't be long, Ellen.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.	You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.	The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
...like macaroni and cheese...	...like grits and butter...
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?	Call me Tom.
Found a job?	No.
Fuck that shit.	Well, it is kind of a long shot...
And what does that cover?	Social issues. Crime prevention.
Good morning...	"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.	We was coming to see you.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?	But you refused me, Dorothy.
So what do we do, General Lee?	Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.	My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.	You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Matt?	Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.	What's your accomplishment.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.	Certainly not at my happy home.
What's the capitol?	Juneau.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.	Got it.
Maybe I'm going too fast.	Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.	You chickenshit punk...
Discreetly.	All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Yes.	I didn't know you were into that.
But she's your *daughter*...	And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --	Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Thanks.	I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?	Yes, Your Majesty.
Are you a bad boy?	Whatiya mean?
Yeah, I heard of it.	That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...	Esdras is a Jew.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!	Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.	Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
I think, therefore I am.	Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?	I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Hicks, don't let him leave.	We ain't going anywhere.
The end.	No sob story is going to change my mind.
Witness?	No way they could have seen it.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.	Are you sure? Not even with my father?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.	Thank you, but I hardly think --
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?	You been home yet?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.	He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
Give him the works.	That's more like it.
I'm lookout.	Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.	Fuck you Vincenzo.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.	That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
Decontamination -- ?	And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.	Do you know who that is?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.	How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Had kind of a long night.	Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Are you alright, young man?	I think so, thank you so much ...
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.	You may.
Ronnie. Please, baby...	Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?	I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
I can't sleep.	Oh... I got something for that.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?	Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Hot chocolate?	We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?	I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
... too young for whisky...	This time we'll make an exception.
Nuh-uh.	Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
No. It wasn't earlier because...	Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Enough of that crap.	I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
But Ted, you're the only...	I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!	You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Four hundred a week, off the books.	Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
-- Knock it off!	-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.	Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
"""I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?"	I say, do what you wanna do.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.	We have no money.  Come on.
What else makes you feel regret?	That I did it again.
Alright. I'll think about it.	Good.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?	That's the idea.
I'll worry about Customs.	Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.	I was just being honest.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.	A hospital? What is it?
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.	You get nothing, Hank, okay?
His office. You mean my old office.	Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Seventeen meters.	Let's get these things lit.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?	It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
"You can't say that to the President... Put back ""President""... Now let's hear how sounds."	"""My dear President""..."
Large?	All right, cop. I want my money.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.	Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.	No. Let's at least finish the set.
Why did you make me flood the school?	We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You can walk away.  We both can.	Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
There were witnesses?	So they said.
His name is Frank.	Frank.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?	Sure.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.	Then don't talk about killing.
As a person?	Yeah. As a girl.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?	Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!	They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.	You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
He always have that shit-eating grin?	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sort of, um...	"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry."
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.	David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I prefered the terrorists.	That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
They'll be up there in a half hour.	Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Yes, something.	Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
I'd better be going.	Er, my check, please.
Brian, look --	Just leave me alone, okay?
We think so.	Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.	You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?	That's a wolf's head.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.	And I'm the better outlaw.
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.	I won't.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.	Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Yes. What is it you want?	Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?	Nobody thinks that.
We are not stealing my mom's car.	Damn straight we are.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?	Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.	His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.	Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?	Come on...
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?	Yes, very pleasant.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.	What do we need another Shill for?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.	Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?	No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
He's comin' back? What for?	'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Wear the belly before you go.	Daddy, no!
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...	Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?	Grounded for the rest of the year?
"Say ""Merrick""."	Merrick...
Twenty.	What's your problem?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.	Yeah?
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?	I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?	Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
There! You said it was boring.	Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
Is that what you want?	I did it. I guess that means something.
Yes?	I found it.
Simon just ejected!	Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
That's it.	Good.
Yes, Daddy.	'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.	Can't we change course?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...	Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
What's so damn funny?	You are.
Would you like us to sing to you?	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
I'm not playing any more golf.	Why not?
What's wrong?	Kincaid and Joey died last night.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.	Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Dunbar's telling the truth.	Wrong answer --
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.	Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
You thirsty?	I'm on duty.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!	Check!
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.	Doesn't look like it.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?	Check at six minutes.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.	Huh?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!	What happened?? Where are we?!
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?	I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?	What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I dream of death mostly.	I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.	Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Now, get out!!	Yes, ma'am!
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.	The best defense is offense.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.	So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.
-- automatic channels open --	-- Remark.
Apipoulai!	Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
What's on your mind?	You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.	That'd be nice.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.	Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Keep the change.	I'm taking you back.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!	I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Do you think she's prettier than I?	Who?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.	Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.	I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Excuse me, Sister?	Yes?
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.	I know it's not.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?	What?
You do?	I only dream about people who are dead.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...	Do you really think so?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.	Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.	We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
Pull out.	I'm ignoring you.
Sir?	You better take this.
I couldn't hear anything.	Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
I will if I can, Frank.	Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
What?	It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.	With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Shit, Dignan.	What the fuck are we doing out here?
You got him involved?	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
My card.	That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?	Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
No.	Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Why?	As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.	Well.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?	It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Then tell them I had a seizure.	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I guess so.	Where's Charlie?
Why, I don't know.	You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.	He always have that shit-eating grin?
Huh?	I figured you already heard.
What?	And some new clothes.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.	Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
Who tripped the alarm?	It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Not that one!	I like her.
Continue the joke.	"He says, ""What's your third wish?"" And the guys says, ""I-I want you to beat me half to death."""
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.	Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
I guess you have to get back home soon?	Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.	Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
What...is...it?	Where are you going?
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.	Just called ta torture us did ya?
No. Not really.	Where did Paul hang out?
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.	A psychiatrist?!
Choices?	I'll never marry you.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.	Outpost doesn't own em.
Wonder where we'll be then.	The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
This man belongs in hospital.	Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Captain Oveur?	Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!	Good.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...	...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
I love you too, Daddy.	Always keep 'em laughing.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.	Oh, Tangerine.
Tomorrow?	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
"I know how to say ""Hello"". Teach me how to say ""Good-bye"", that's all I need."	Apipoussan!
I've gotta go in.	Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Do you love your father?	Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
And I said I would never leave you.	And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
At least I won lunch.	Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
I asked for a policeman.	You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.	Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Fireman shit?	Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday	Good coloring.
No. What? No. I know.	It's more like a date.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.	Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --	I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Migrants?	Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
-- I should tear your head off.	Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?	What's a Negro.
How much?	Half a million.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.	I wasn't about to.
Please don't go.	At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Musta got some primo bondsman.	Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.	'At's-a fine.
You took the chalice.	Yes.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!	Is it true?
Who is Don?	Don? Are you in with them?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?	I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.	Really?
I understand.	Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.	You're compulsive.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?	I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
We do not want your tired and sick.	It is your corrupt we claim.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.	You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.	Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.	Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.	My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.	No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?	No.
You get it when I get her.	Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.	Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
"Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His ""Fix."""	What do you want?
Only holds five.	Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?	It looks awful.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.	Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Unidentified Flying Objects.	Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.	The families who control the casinos?
I should do this.	Do what?
Al.	Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.	That about sums it up.
Was it -- swine?	No... it was a seven letter word.
Yeah.	When?
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.	For the third time.
Is that a raincoat?	Yes, it is.
He did!	I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.	No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.	Why?
He asked me to stay.	And I'm asking you -
Calvin?!	Right here!
Then that's all you had to say.	But
Nothing.	People just...disappear.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...	You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I thought you played by the rules.	I thought you didn't.
I want... to marry you!	I... accept your proposal!
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.	I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Why are you doing that?	I haven't brushed yet.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.	A ring.  I wanted a ring.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?	I am always receptive to suggestions.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.	So what do we do, General Lee?
Stop it. This is just sad.	Swimming. Swimming is good.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!	The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
She's got my word.	She's gonna want to hear for herself.
That's what you say, Cates...	Yeah.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?	Okay, I believe you.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?	Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
Have you had one?	Never.
How long has he been in there?	I don't know.
It was snowing.	There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?	Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Get out. Both of you.	Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Christ. Is that an axe?	Yep.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.	Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.	Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
Guess I'm on a roll.	She's such a long way home for you.
Been ripping off fire stations?	It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
She did.	What did you say to her?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.	Okay.
Your Excellency!	You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
I miss you.	Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Who are all these?	They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:	Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Luis is a despicable twit.	Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
What about back home?	No.
Yes, he did.	How'd he do?
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.	They're on autopilot.
That's a great handle.	Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.	We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Boys...	Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.	The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
What's the other?	Excuse me?
I see.	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Four months?	I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Vodka tonic.	Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.	I'm not following you.
Casey.  She's my only friend.	What about me?
With what?	The ten dollars.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.	The dishes are juiced up, too.
Jeffrey nothing.	You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Where's the cabin?	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.	What do you mean?
"The ""real you""."	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.	There's nothing wrong with me!
Hey, you wanna bet?	I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Yes.	I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Right. The blond guy.	OK. That's wrong.
I've decided not to run for President.	Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.	Guaranteed, eh?
Promise me boys.	We promise.
... love ...	Peter ...
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!	Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.	Yeah.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.	Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Isn't he a little moody?	Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
You think I'm improving?	Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You think I'm up for it?	You learned from the best.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.	Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
You a good pool player.	Got a little lucky.
I wanted to see you.	What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I'm out.	WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Matt, come here!	Why?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....	It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
How do you know?	I never forget a pussy... cat.
Is he breathing?	I think so.
I hate him.	I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
Yes, Doctor.	You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.	Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Great.	How's Austin?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.	We are not fine.
I said we are totally booked.	Two at nine? Perfect.
If they can't see you, what's the point?	Survive today, that's the point.
I didn't have a choice.	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
My letters of appointment.	Appointment to what?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.	If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
What did he bring him in for?	Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
What is your nationality?	I'm a drunkard.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?	I'm hungry
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?	Well no -- not exactly -- but --
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?	This is a TV show, not a music video.
Some time.	What can I offer you, Eve?
"Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a ""skinny little fag"" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back."	Yah?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!	Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.	Which I didn't have.
Whose blood is that, Jay?	West's. Any kindling for afire?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.	What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I don't know any jokes about your name.	Huckleberry Hound?
Assail your ears for one night.	It's her favorite band.
Why weren't you at the platform?	I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.	Quiet, Mother.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.	Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?	Yes. I do.
Good gracious!  What is this?	You are going to drive to the frontier.
What?	"""Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."""
But...has anyone seen him in London?	Actually, yes.
I've tried to change her mind.	It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--	And you were a sympathetic ear.
You mock us with a smile?	I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
My grandmother's .	What?
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?	Sorry. Never heard of her.
How are you?	Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
So. What should I do now?	Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
'Have a look?	Sure.
He is only curious to know who you are.	If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?	Yes, Monsieur.
I'm sorry.	That's a dumb thing to say.
That's exactly what he says about you.	Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
So you were home last night?	Yes.
I never said they were boring.	"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""
Yeah, right...	Shut up.  West's dead.
Hello?	Hey Murph.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?	Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Two weeks.	I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
What?!	Good enough.
Under the table!	The best table in the house.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.	No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.	Life is waiting.
What are you lookin' at?	Nothing.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!	Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
You ask them.	Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.	Oh, you got a problem with that?
Those things in your hands.	These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.	That's my responsibility.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?	Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Okay.	Anything you can tell me?
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.	Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?	No idea who. No idea why ...
Your first assignment was Geneva.	That's a lie!
It wasn't very good last night, was it?	I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.	People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?	Could be Leon's.
You told me Bourne was dead.	There was a mistake.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.	Oh, thanks.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!	Ilene, are you crazy?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.	He wasn't acting?
Making Hutch David Soul?	Right. The blond guy.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?	Nuh-uh.
Is that a request or a command?	You know what I mean
I remember now, it was before the explosion --	Oh, you remember now --
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.	You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.	Any exceptions?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?	I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.	Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Thank you.	Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.	Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.	In other words, scurvy.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.	Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.	Forgive me father.
Where are you going?	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?	Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
They were wearing masks.	Of course they were. How many?
Sure, Dave, what's up?	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?	He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Oh, really?	Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Anything.	A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
You gonna let me keep any of it?	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Yes...	You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
I like her.	And don't be so obvious!
But you hate Joey	Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
And tell him not to delay.	Yes, sir.
I thought you hated those people.	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
All right, you two, move along.	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
I'm happy I amuse you.	Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!	Hallelujah.
Of course not.	Do you have a daughter?
"...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a ""system."" ""Losers,"" who played games of chance. He could ""read"" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again."	What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
Pardon me?	Never mind. I'm the owner.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.	Luther was part of the gang?
We don't judge here.	OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Truman Capote.	I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Where'd you get this?!!	A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
What do you listen to, Stephen?	You don't know... nobody knows...
I'm nervous, too.	Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...	Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.	I'm not really hungry.
I know.	And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?	We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Who's Mr. Henry?	You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.	It's been six years.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.	Ah.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.	Tom... she's dead.
Why two?	He is traveling with a lady.
Fuck!	me up the...
What's this?	Open it.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.	Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
That's what it looks like to me.	And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.	Yeah. Good bye.
How much did he pay you?	Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Six days ago, yes.	You must be mad...!
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.	Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
"Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like ""twenty-five to life"" pissed."	I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
We can't let him get away.	Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
But...	Two... THREE. GO!
Sure.	Do I make you horny?
We're renegades from despair.	Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Why not?	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.	Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Now?	Yes, now.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?	Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.	You got a real big mouth, convict.
Mr. McCaffrey...	Nice boat.
How a girl get like that?	Like I told you.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?	I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.	Odin!
Where's my cat?	I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Tension. It'll go.	Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
Stop waving that thing around.	You sure we're clear?
Put them on the table.	No.
You're sick of my company?	No! I mean, of course not. No.
No, did you use a condom?	Only sailors use condoms, man.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.	Sounds respectable.
How much time does he have left?	You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.	You're going to have a bachelor party?
What are you doing?	Getting dressed. I've got to go.
What? I can feel you looking at me.	That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...	Who are you?
Six to the left. One to the right.	He's on vacation.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?	Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Okay.	Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.	Answer the phone.
Hello, Sam.	Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
I know, Dad.	I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
I'm afraid not.	Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
It's pretty.	I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
You know it's not like that --	Do I?
You're sure?	Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?	I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
I won't. You interested?	Maybe.
Uh-huh.	Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.	I see what you mean.
Daddy, don't start with this again.	Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
His chest was hamburger --	That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?	Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
No. Come on.	NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.	Is that so?
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.	Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.	They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
It couldn't be better.	That's not what I hear.
What happened?	He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
"Let me tell you ""scary,"" Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a ""lifer"" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent ""raisin ranch"" where they'll change me twice a day."	That's it, I'm goin'...
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.	I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.	Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?	No, Cole, I...
I just thought you should know.	Know what?
I'm not frightened... of anything...	You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.	You saved Kendall's life --
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?	Let's see...  That you were with-
No.  I think it's just right.	And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?	The key, Wade.
Drink!	To fame.. salud..
I wanna have supper waitin'.	We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.	I guess we'll need another locker.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?	I guess.
Thirty-five.	You don't look thirty-five.
Yeah.	Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
Who the hell are you?	Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
That's it?	Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Vodka!	Shot of vodka, please.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.	What are you talking about. What people?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.	Pinback, throw me the chart log.
No, you do it. I can't sing.	Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
I'm more comfortable around my people.	Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Well, it was an accident.	They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Not right now?  Okay, when?	Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.	How'd you learn so much about dreams?
Do you like to read?	I can't read. Nobody taught me.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?	This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
I know, Dad.	I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
Who's that?	"The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says ""boo."""
I told Mother I took care of you.	You lied.
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...	Pee...Per...Man.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.	"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.	No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.	And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.	Bent?
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.	Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Stephen ready?	Aye.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?	Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.	Oh he forced you, huh?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.	"Like de prophets say, ""Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."""
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?	He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?	Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.	y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.	We both lied to him.
We'll find it. Just calm down.	No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
I come from a big family.	Meant no offense.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--	Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.	I have acted as I think fit.
My mom is gone.	Where is she?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?	What do you mean, it changes?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.	Roger, Wolf One.
I told Teddy about you.	What'd he say?
What is it, Mary?	Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
What's that you're wearing?	It's called Black Leather.
The king can do no wrong!	Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
Sorry. What?	HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Let's get naked.	You're on.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.	I'm not hungry.
Yeah.	This way.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?	Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Alright.  Go ahead.	That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.	Roger that.
You gonna do what I say, got it?	Yes.
You okay?	I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?	Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.	So what did I have an effect on ?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?	"That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss"", two words in my language which mean ""excrement"" and ""cranium""."
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.	It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
He said you ran away from home.	No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.	I love you, Elaine.
Where are you going?	Pest control.
Hello.	Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Doesn't sound like me.	Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?	Yes - sure
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.	Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?	He did. Captain Renault did.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...	An unholy trinity ...
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.	Is everything ready?
What about me?	I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
I want to go back to Vienna.	Now?
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.	How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
What?	Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.	It's insured.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?	Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Ha, ha, ha.	No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!	It was... It was...
Lazarus?	Oh! Gave me a start.
Whaddya think?	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.	You cook very well!
We'll speak soon.	'Night.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.	Why is that?
For the third time.	Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
Sorry, Mom!	You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
All of them!  Just lies!	Colon!  Don't!
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.	Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.	Look up, sunshine
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?	What? That's disgusting!
Will he wish to know the details of this night?	He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Come back tonight.	Tonight?
You did?	I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Oh? There's proof now?	Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I don't hate you.	Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
I've never been given a fair shot.	You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
Your mother was blind?	Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.	You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Where did he get all that information?	From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
You hated West more than any of us.	Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
What's wrong?	We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.	So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Doc Mimms will --	Shush.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.	I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.	And then?
Yeah. As a girl.	Yes. I do.
No, why?	Is David acting strangely?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.	All the same, you must name an amount.
You like it?	Bravo!
What are you going to tell the little ones?	I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I hope not.	Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
I most definitely say I am.	Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
That was a compliment.	Will you go with me?
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.	No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.	Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
I heard ya lady is wild.	No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --	Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Didn't you visit the campus?	I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --	He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Are you alright, Wade?	Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.	Any messages, Carmen?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?	It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!	You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	No, I don't mind.
I. sold the car.	You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.	We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Cuba.	Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.	And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
SHUT UP!	ROW!
We're not finished yet --	You wanna bet?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Me?	No, that door over there.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We mustn't let him land!	Who?
Why don't you answer?	I know I won't be your puppet.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .	He says he can't get away in the daytime.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.	All right, it's a matter of death.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!	Apparently so.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.	Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Yeah.	So did I.
She doesn't need to know.	I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Where are we going?	I'll tell you when we get there.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.	How is gregor?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?	Why, I don't know.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?	Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.	Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks	What is?
Death.	The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
You've been hurt.	I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No.	Lie down on the bed.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...	She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.	Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.	Can you protect me?
I'll get the book.	No. There's nothing new.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.	Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Going north?	You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
Wait!  Wait!	What is it?!
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Don't give him any more.	He gets as much as he wants.
We don't label people here, Scott.	No, he's really evil.
Yes, thank you.	Hello, Helen.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?	Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.	Shut up.
A card?	Yes, sir.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.	Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
Do I get to kiss her too?	If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've done some questionable things.	Also extraordinary things.
Knock it off. Now.	Tell him about me, Shadow?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.	Yeah...I guess.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.	You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.	Deep, real deep.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.	Oh? There's proof now?
What?	Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!	We see you next harvest.
... preserve...	Secret ...
Who?	Those fucking Mob assholes.
No, you may not.	Okay.  Fine.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.	You rat.
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Good morning.	John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.	Why was I not informed of this?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.	You're also a fool.
No?	No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!	Me get heap firewater --
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!	Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?	Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Little ones.	Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.	No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
You got a lotta nerve.	Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Felt like a large asteroid.	Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Jack?	Yeah.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?	What is this, a game?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.	The Prince left him only that choice.
What's this?	Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
It's a lot of money, Pam.	We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?	No.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.	Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...	Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!	Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?	I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Not one.	Have you not a man whom you value?
It's a tradition.	I know, Dad.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.	No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I'm afraid that's impossible.	Impossible?
Yes, very soon.	Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.	I can't find the second one, sir.
I wasn't about to.	I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.	The poet? What ever happened to him?
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?	Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
And you're too young.	I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Talby, Talby, can you read me?	Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.	Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.	Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
Well	Well, what?
A B-24 Liberator.	Liberator...
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.	I am George.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.	I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
I'm not following you.	If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.	They're all divorced?
George Zipp said that?	"And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""
It's all right! It isn't happening!	But, Father, it IS!
Whereas you are.	Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.	You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Why should WE care?	Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.	Well... isn't it great?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
Why doesn't it never work out?	What?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?	Sure
My god. I think that was a MiG.	A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.	I'm sure they're around.
You trust me?	I'll pay you.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Thanks for the help.	After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
God forgive you, for how you done me...	Let go...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...	You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Are you AFRAID?	GOOD MORNING!
Order me a pastrami for after?	Cole slaw, ice tea?
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.	I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Oh, it's my party.	Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Hector woudn't do anything.	But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Oh, no.	I knew you'd understand. Here.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.	I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.	Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.	Yes. Exactly.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.	You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?	I don't know.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?	I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
I thought we were on our way.	Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!!
What are you, a cop?	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?	She got two of them.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --	This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
I braided them.	Must have taken a hell of a long time.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.	I'd use the word insane.
Macbeth, right?	Right.
Was Future Man adopted?	Jesus Christ! No.
Oh, yeah.	That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Merry Christmas eve.	Not if you work for FedEx.
It matters not, he is thy king!	-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Yes.	Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Hostile and uncooperative.	Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!	I'm really sorry!
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
You... you need to go to the police.	I told you I can't, not yet.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.	Give me another one, please.
I thought your parents were in Italy.	They are.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?	The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Did we get it?	Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --	So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Courtney? Dinner?	I can't.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.	Why?
I'm cold.	Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.	What do you have, Danny?
As we near the Pole...	There's got to be an explanation!
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.	And we got rid of the red head.
Dunbar will testify that you were.	Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.	It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.	But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
That's true	There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.	Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Hold on.	Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --	-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...	I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.	Then how is time travel possible?
Coffee sucked.	"And just this year, ""Brian's Sound Spectrum"". Your own company even. Big step."
Jack, are you okay?	Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Where is he?	Dead.
We're alive.	An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?	Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Yes, I should think so.	Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
I need to do it.	Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?	I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
No problem.	Thanks.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.	Pamela Landy?
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --	Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Here, I didn't get any.	Here, have some.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.	Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!	I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
About raping me?	About NOT raping you...
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.	There's a furnace.
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Move it.	Where?
No... we don't...	The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?	I guess so...
A born freak can only go uphill.	Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.	When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.	I'll secure the perimeter.
I'm not bargaining!	Then you are too ambitious.
Howard, your one o'clock.	Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Are you okay?	I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.	But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.	So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.	You didn't want to farm?
I guess you've seen some bad things.	Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Oh, God...	It didn't go off.
Got a little lucky.	Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
When will he be back?	Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.	And how was your Christmas?
He tapped that.	Naw!
Then why especially does it have to be in German?	Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
That's what you want, isn't it?	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Oh, I could die...	Over this?
What'll we do?	I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
You killed my husband.	For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Here I am, Father...	Send for my car...
She's alive, sweetie.	Where is she?!
Call me later.	You sure you want me to?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?	Not without Leeloo.
It's okay. It's okay.	My secret lover.
I just don't want to.	Okay.
I made it go down the toilet.	What?
What's the story?	Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.	It's not that.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?	Of course.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?	She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.	Yes?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.	I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?	He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!	Not quite...
Okay Frank.	What kinda beer do you like?
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.	Harold!
Maybe we shouldn't go.	The faggot speaks.
Which one?	Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?	Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I don't give a damn about his girl...	Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.	Good-bye, darling.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.	I like it up here.
Of what?	The hotel.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Don't mind if I do.	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
If she is, the machine works.	The machine works.  She is.
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
Such as?	Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
What do you think?	I think you better put him on ice, man.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?	I'm not telling you.
It's good to see you.	Where to?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?	We've found all of them.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.	We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.	Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.	Who?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.	That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Don't go!  Please.	I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.	Right... What's that mean again?
Yes.	Where are you now?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.	Probably see you at the book store.
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Right in there, pal.	If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --	I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
I say Freddie, what are you about?	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Excuse me?	Is Dunbar cute?
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.	Thanks.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.	"What the hell is a ""Treadstone?"""
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?	Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?	Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?	Yes.
We're not going to make it.	Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.	You don't know what you're getting into here.
I don't know. He has pains.	Where?
"The official term for it is ""Clusterfuck"". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant..."	It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.	That's too bad.
Spooning the sherbet.	Can I take your picture?
Strategically.	-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.	I actually know how this works.
I think she's great.	Me too. There's this poem --
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?	Do you know?
What the hell are you doing?	Who's Camille?
Do you feel all right, sir?	Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.	John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?	Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Hmm.	The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!	If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.	Let's go.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.	Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
What about them?	They obviously weren't designed for racing.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.	I don't get involved with guns.
Got any KISS?	You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.	Can I put it in your mouth?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?	I had that fire. He didn't listen!
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.	With the teeth of your zipper?
What did she say?	Beats me.
Brian. What's wrong?	You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Start it.	I can't...
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
I'm a what?	All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.	What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
YOU'RE A LIAR!	Look at me.
No. You sure you're okay?	I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...	That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.	What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.	Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
You're light a deuce.	Am I?
No.	How do you know?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?	White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.	They had to be dealt with!
The second note.	The second note to wake the Gods...
I beg your pardon?	I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Probably see you at the book store.	Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
And who says what is wrong.	And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Yes.	Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.	Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
You can hit me, if you want to.	No, please. I won't.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.	A secret service agent. It must be.
I won't do it anymore.	Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Well, I left some money in there.	Where?
When'd you get back?	Ah. Couple days ago.
Why won't you check out LV-426?	Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
They're in the approach corridor.	On my way.
How you doing, Bob?	Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
Goin' dove huntin'?	You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.	Put them on the table.
You're kidding!	No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!	Sorry, that's the largest city.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.	Is there something wrong with the phone?
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.	When did you first find out he was alive?
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.	The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.	All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
I can't. You're drunk.	It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
-- Shhh.	What are you listening to?
He'll need clothes... some money...	"Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of ""seeing the world,"" isn't it?"
What do you want?	Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.	A pleasure.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.	The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Always has been.	This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.	No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.	Next.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.	I'm proud of you, lad.
You told me that part already.	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.	After the cold war ...
What's that supposed to mean?	It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Where am I?	Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Bad?	Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!	That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
How potent?	"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...	If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?	I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.	I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.	Of course.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.	You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
What, you've never seen one before?	In the Field Museum once.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.	No, Mother.
Hey you!!	All right -
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.	How do you know?
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.	For what?
The workhouse.	Yes! The workhouse!
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...	Vito Cornelius?
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.	For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
It's not for sale.	You haven't heard my offer.
Shut up.	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!	Mum! Dad!
Why not?	I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
No! I mean, of course not. No.	Teasing you is completely unfair.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.	It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?	That's true.
No. I really don't.	That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Can we do that?	We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
You did great, Ichiro.	I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?	That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Not if I find the right girl.	And what's this right girl like?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...	But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Yeah.	C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Machine's in?	He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.	I am?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.	And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --	"See, Ray, this is what we call ""good cop, bad cop"". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established."
Hey, what about me?	And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.	Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Who, Levi --	Childs.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.	What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
We want Mrs. Peel.	Dead, I'm afraid.
What's happening?	Debbie's marrying Rick.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.	Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Like you could find one	See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.	But you knew that, right?
Hey.  I'm a professional.	Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?	I don't know.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.	Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
Excuse me?	What's the other thing you're scared of?
Yes?	Be careful.
Big date tonight?	Yeah... guess so.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.	Let me repeat -- Why not?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.	Do they know yet?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.	Oh.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Is it the truth?	There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?	Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.	That's a shame.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.	Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Oh now, don't be silly.	Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...	You talking piffle, son?
This is mole.  It's good.	I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Frank.	I think he saved my life.
Shit. You better tell me something.	I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?	Four years.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.	No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
You were how long on this?	Forty-three days.
You're just going to have to trust me.	I don't trust anyone.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.	All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.	Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.	Sam?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.	That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.	Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...	Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Do any pupils come to the house?	Not that I've seen.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.	Thanks.
I don't gamble.	Ever?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.	"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?	We never had a problem with that before.
Everybody say Ho!	Ho!
Are you sure?	Yeah. I'm sure.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.	I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...	Request; life support systems check.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.	You're kidding.
Let's go while there is still time.	Where?
My dress'll reek.	Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.	Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.	Where are you going?
They got nothing.	This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Oh her.	Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
Good morning.	Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!	He's leaving...
Is that the manager?	Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
So he drank himself into a stuper?	The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Do you remember what we talked about?	Naomi, I guess.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.	Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .	Why, I needed a
How'm I doing, boss?	Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
Good.	Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.	They go.
Better'n me?	Better than what you give.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --	Our money situation is not good.
He's at a board meeting.	Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Is there a problem?	No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.	Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Egad, were you horrified?	No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.	Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where do we start looking for this guy?	Where would you look for the mafia?
Sorry.	Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.	I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.	Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?	I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.	Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!
Hello, daddy.	My bourbon.
I don't want to talk about it.	Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...	I didn't know your size.
Only sailors use condoms, man.	Not in the Nineties.
The place is falling apart.	I'm doing fine.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.	You're a superstitious fucker.
William - he asked me to meet him here.	Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
That's true.	Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Yes, Mother.	And something to sharpen them with?
Yeah.	Did I say thanks?
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?	No.  that was the last one.
Does anyone know his politics?	No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Jack?	Yeah?
Well, that's blunt!	I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Where was I?	You were asleep.
I demand action.	No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
What do you want from me?	I, I don't know.
What I love.	Get a good picture in your mind.
That's lovely.	Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
But if we have not caught Wallace --	He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.	Goodbye.
What do I have to do for it?	Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?	What is what?
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.	My father has a bad memory, too?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?	I don't know.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?	When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
"Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- ""D"" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?"	The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.	Marion!  What did you tell the police?
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.	I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?	What other job you got?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.	Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.	I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?	Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'	Stop it, Jack.
"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""	Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.	And the Germans can't match it?
How's Uncle Sibeal?	Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
-- my coat -- but we should --	-- what? --
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?	Excuse me?
I want to do it.	Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.	Stop! Take me back!
What is the meaning of that phone call?	Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
I can't dance fast.	Really?
It's true.	I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Have you identified it?	It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
What are you doing?	Saving your life.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
I want another shot, Sir.	Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.	Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...	Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
"The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: ""A country boy can survive!"""	Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
You noticed...	There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.	Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
To come back to our roots.	Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
You're sick, Deckard.	I never felt better.
Right, partner.	Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I can't say. Really	I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?	Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
My father always wanted a boy.	Really?  I fail to see the connection.
It didn't used to be that way.	I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.	Is that how Larry feels?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.	You love him, don't you?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.	Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.	You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You lost me.	Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.	Did it work?
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.	Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --	"Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my ""great second chance"", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --"
I wish we did. You married?	Um, no.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.	Yes, sir.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --	-- it hasn't been two years --
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
So that's what you been doing?	Damn skippy.
Yeah. I know about that.	LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
I really don't know.	Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.	Why?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.	No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.	Any other vices?
...Yyes	Yyyess.
What are you doing tonight?	Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Clementine.	That's your look for me.
Good night?	Not particularly.
Yes. I do.	So do I.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.	What?
Is that him?	Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.	Do too much, I'll die.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.	Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!	Don't want to film this?
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...	Feel free.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.	What can I do for you today?
Conklin up front.	I'll get the book.
Is there a problem?	No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.	You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.	I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
What do you want?	I want you to hurt me.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.	Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Now what do you want to talk about?	Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.	It was exciting.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.	C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Oh -- you mean... worm?	No, that wasn't it...
Snuff?	What you see is what I got, mister.
Yes.	How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
What!	Teddy was killed last night.
What?	Listen, it's not erasing.
Look, I'm sorry I --	-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Lillian was here. In Lawford.	Huh?
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.	No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!	Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
I don't think I will, Rick.	Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Can I speak to you in confidence?	Huh? Oh. She's alright.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.	Thanks.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.	Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Your mom was a dancer?	She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
What the hell is that sound?	Vengeance.
Why do you ask?	No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.	That's the old Rick!
It was a combination of all three.	And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...	Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.	December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.	With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
Sir?	Talk to the bomb.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.	Well as it turns out I did.
Do you see the maintenance panel?	Got it.
How do you feel, Jack?	Bruised.
Beg pardon?	Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.	Manages what?
Any idea when she'll be back?	None.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.	Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.	Watch the news?
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.	Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.	I'll give it my best shot.
Very funny.	Alice...
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.	Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.	The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?	...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.	What's in Sandusky?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?	What?
Alex?	Yes?
What the hell happened?	They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.	I won't. You interested?
He was, like, a total babe	But you hate Joey
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?	*You* taught her, I suppose...
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?	Right here someplace.
Any activity?	Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.	I bet I would.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?	Want to buy?
But the line has to be drawn.	Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
You're a good soldier, Bill.	I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Yeah?	I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
No. But you're in very big trouble.	Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Of course.	Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
What?!	Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!	Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--	I don't want to move away.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.	I remember once when your account checked.
How do I know you're telling the truth?	He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Holy shit.	Yeah.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.	He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?	I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.	Yes?
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...	Shut up.
Do you like Inez?	As a person?
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!	Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.	Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I could use the walk.	Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
That's it.	It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
Who would do such a thing?	Exactly.
Billy Bear...	Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?	Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, you're married.	Not yet. Not married.
Maybe so.	It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.	The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Syevodnya?	Syevodnya
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
He's asleep. We were up very late.	Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
A Russian?	It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I forgive you.	Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
What's going on?	We're under attack.
Is that your chiquita?	No, my friend knows her.
No.	She just seemed... depressed... ?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.	That's scary sounding.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.	What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.	Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.	But --
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.	Pull the cash.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?	No.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--	Yech...
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.	I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Who sent you to Greece?	A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.	Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.	Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Yes. In that order.	And what about you, anything?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.	What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.	Then what else can we do?
You're doing just fine.	Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?	Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.	Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
yeah?	I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
You won't at the square this mornin'.	Get me ten bags of mulch.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.	Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?	Easy enough for you.
How?	Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.	Happy now?
y-y-yes--	Want to come out?
May I ask by whom?	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
The corner!  Ready?	Do it!
Where's the name sheet?	Nobody's named this one yet.
"What's ""Cellar Door""?"	"A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful."
Okay.	What is it?
So, Larry, how have you been?	Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
What're you doin' here?	Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.	You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
I forgive you.	You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
You didn't tell him about me?	No.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.	I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.	A what?
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...	...aconite get it dat cheap.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.	I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.	Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
My son?	Yes.  Scott!
Lord's name.	Mother Mary, full of grace.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.	"Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a ""skinny little fag"" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back."
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.	I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?	I didn't think there was an alarm.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!	"Are we on ""Cops"" again?"
Namely?	"Our band ""Mystery"" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere."
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?	Lots of people...
Can't we change course?	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.	No.
That I am very little different from him.	Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.	You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.	That's why Kong loves her!
How did you know?	Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.	Right.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.	We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?	Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Relax!	I'm drowning! Help!
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.	Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Whatever play I maker just back me up.	If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.	Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
It's lonely in there, in my room.	My name is...
Gin.	Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Thanks.	Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.	Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.	I didn't plan this.
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!	I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.	Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.	DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
How?	You never disappointed me.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?	We're starving.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.	That's right!
No way!  He's mine!	We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...	It wasn't me; you have my word.
...everyone has been very kind.	Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
You know women normally change five times more than men.	You get that off the screen?
Yes!	I like it.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.	Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!	It was amazing.
What's the matter, Charlie?	I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.	Backdraft.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...	I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.	We're not going to make it.
I think, before.	Seems too coincidental that way.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?	Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
What the hell is that?	Gin.
Well, you did invite me here.	Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
A tortoise.  What's that?	Know what a turtle is?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.	You don't understand! It's her father...
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?	Ask Monsieur Rick.
Yes. John wants it.	A dressing bag?
Avoid-all-contact-day.	What?
They said.	Hmm.
What are you doing here?	Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
You haven't got a uniform?	No, sir.
I'm sorry.	That was a compliment.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.	Werewolves simply do not exist.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...	Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
I was wrong!!	Is this your house?
What is it?	Just some fatherly advice.
You liked what I brung ya?	Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Some of the old songs, Sam.	Yes, ma'am.
What? Who the devil are you?	I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.	What is that?
What time?	Common time.
Who is she?	She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?	Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.	There isn't any us.
Where are your parents?	I don't know, where are yours?
That's my responsibility.	That's your domain.
She ever pull down her shades?	Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
Shut down accelerators.	Accelerators down.
Do you believe it?	Should I?
Three agents killed by bad weather...	... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Cole?	Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
That's not what happened to your parents.	Then what?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.	I was?
What's wrong with Applejack?	He's having a heart attack or something.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Oh Jesus.	He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yeah.	This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
I don't think I've slept in a year.	You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
What would your girlfriend think of that?	I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't care. They're out.	Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?	Uh, Matthew...
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.	Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.	But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
A fellow investor.	Hmm.
Who's Ted Bundy?	Forget it.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.	I'll hurry back.
You don't want the extra police pay?	I'm not saying that.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?	Nothing. Are you alright?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?	Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
He admitted it.	Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Where are the others?	Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
No.	Are you scared?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.	It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?	There aren't any little boys on your floor.
When's the next Jumbo?	The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.	I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Hasn't affected his work, though.	Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?	...yes.
What is this?!	... It's Harcourt.
CONTINUED	Well, what is it?
Yeah.	You might not kill it.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.	Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Then you don't wanna work hard?	I don't wanna work at all.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?	Well, there's someone I think might be --
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I	Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
No one calls you that.	She does. She says I sleep all day.
There's got to be an explanation!	There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
Don't mind if I do.	LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.	I'd like that.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...	I never knew you smoked.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.	C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.	Uh huh.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.	But Marcus denied it?
Your mess.	Then shut up.
The bitch.	The important thing is that we have a winner...
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?	We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Hey, I just...	Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...	You're right.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --	Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.	Understandable.  Lime?
Who is...	The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.	Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Cameron.	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
It's bad luck.	Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
And that's it. Do you have it?	You go fast!
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...	Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Yes.	But surely you know...?
Milo? I'm Danny.	Oh hi.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...	Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Can't make enough swords!	Can't make enough axe-heads!
Damn... Are you alright?	They took my daughter.
Yeah, I guess.	But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.	Why should they think that?
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.	Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
This is my stop.	I'm amused.
What is her name?	Gretchen. We're going together now.
Mom?	Yes dear?
Wolf One -- say intentions.	I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
You noticed..	OK, you can turn around!
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?	After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
Any exceptions?	25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Yes?	Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Did you like it, then?	How could I not?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.	Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Marion, stop this.	What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Where are you going?	To bed.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?	Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.	No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.	Great. I'll see you soon.
Why? Do you enjoy it?	I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
What?	Shut up. Have you got your passport?
In the sight of God that is a sin.	What do you want?
You believe that?	I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.	It's pretty old.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.	But everybody's having such a good time.
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --	You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!	They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --	I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Okay.	Okay.
Ride with me, cousin?	I could use the walk.
Okay.	Shall we?
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.	I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.	My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Do you like me?	Yes, I like you.
In English, Pinkerton.	There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.	But you're my father -
But I'm afraid of--	Don't look down.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is	Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.	I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Theoretically.	-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
By who?	His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?	No. They would never do that.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.	Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?	Yes, Sire.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!	Bites what?
I brought it.	Let's see it.
Uh huh, pleasure.	Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Yes... I remember Mary	You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
I think so.	I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It's me. Norther Winslow.	I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
I didn't mean to!	Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Is there something we can do?	I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.	Let's go, Reggie.
You okay?	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
In my house, you watch that lip...	Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Heathcliffe.	Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?	I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
No, I don't mind.	I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?	Humiliated?
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.	Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.	The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.	Sorry.
What are we going to do about this?	I'll handle it.
Oh God, how horrid.	I'm Joel.
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!	What do you mean?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.	Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?	Well, it's not a short one.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.	You're lying --
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?	We paid attention in school.
He all right?	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
What's wrong with you?	I just had a mental picture of...
Staedert, do you read me?	I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Together we stand!	You can't let Erik do THAT.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...	The cockpit? What is it?
I lost them, that's what happened.	How did they get away?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
They're pretty.  Can I have them?	Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
What am I wanted for?	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?	Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?	Had to be done.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.	And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.	Sir -
Five by five, Frank.	Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.	Lunatic?
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.	So now you suddenly care about my future?
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.	Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
But you don't look very happy.	*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.	You need a ride?
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?	Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
IT'S OPEN!	DO YOU SEE TEEM?
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.	You don't think God'll mind, do you?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?	HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...	A lot of people like our singing.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.	It's their Presidential Suite.
I've got a job.	What job?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.	I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.	Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.	But you're OK?
Yes?	One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
What about the sender?	Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Did you solve your problems?	Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.	I know.
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?	Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!	Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
You played it for her and you can play it for me.	Well, I don't think I can remember it.
You sayin' you'll do what?	You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
There's a way to get a guy's attention.	My mission in life.
They met at Auburn.	What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.	Holy shit!
At church?	Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Can't you take a guess?	Well...not for another two hours.
"I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling ""peanuts"" in front of the House of Representatives."	Oh no, I can't do it.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?	Ho-yah!
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.	Well do something about it.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.	Did you?
You've got to let us try, Skipper --	'Us?'
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!	I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.	It's okay--I don't mind.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.	I'll bet it's a fortune.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.	Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.	Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Me?	I forgive you.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.	I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.	We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.	You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
What's that?	Oh, let's not talk about it.
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.	How long... how long I been out?
Hey, I don't believe it.	Hiya, kid.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --	-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I know that. But you can now.	I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Nice car.	She's my baby.
You're entitled to your opinion.	It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
He's your cute thing.	I can't even keep fish alive.
How about five hundred.	What?!
What for?	For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
He's too well-protected right now.	We can't just sit here, Austin.
No.	Looks like you'd make a good runner.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?	Yes. Yes, of course.
Teddy was killed last night.	What're you -- what?
Eighteen.	I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?	Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.	Just a little overworked, maybe.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.	Yeah? What have you been up to?
You're not having a good time are you?	Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.	You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.	Well . . . ?
What's the matter with them?	Just say something cheerful.
So how'd you get caught?	Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
How's the case going?	What case?
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.	What's that, sir?
Yes?	Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
What was that, Korfin?	I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Also extraordinary things.	Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.	Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.	And if it should change?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?	Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?	My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
But I... I need those books.	You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
These are wonderful.	It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.	Armed.
Are we hacking or asking?	Yes. In that order.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?	Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Then why did you ask me?	I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Sorry.	Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?	Do you want to talk to him?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.	I'm not.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?	To pay for the next expedition, of course.
The outlets.	That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.	Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.	I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...	I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
That's even a greater honor.	I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.	Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!	How many pupils do you have?
Who's that, Ted?	Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.	Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Eight-fifty.	Seven-fifty.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?	No.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.	Word wit'cha. In private.
J&B. Straight.	Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
No. You never worked Berlin.	My first job.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.	No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.	Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.	"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it."
"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."	Olivier's in that, right?
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.	Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.	Of course not.
In the Field Museum once.	It works.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?	Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...	They're no friends of mine.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!	Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?	You stuff sausage in it.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.	Please, it really doesn't matter.
What is it?	I want to go!
You weren't dreaming about me.	I was!
But HOW?	I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?	He wants money.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.	This has to be a big mistake.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?	The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
Hello, Louis.	How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.	And I'm supposed to care?
I know. Anyway --	Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.	You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
I'm staying with the Countess.	I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.	No, you...didn't?
Jeezus!	Sorry.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...	Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?	I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....	The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?	Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
But not completely inconceivable?	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
He's just playing big brother.	Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
How many aces are left?	Five.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?	Stop it. I'm...
Actually, yes.	Hmmm.
You've never had bad dreams before?	Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.	Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.	Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.	What are you talkin' about?
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!	To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?	They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
How are we feeling tonight?	No.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...	Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
What do you want?	A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.	I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.	Beats forty hours on a plane.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.	Now, how are you going to do that?
I sure don't hate you.	I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...	The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
You're done.  End of story.	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.	Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Oh, come on --	We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
See them, Elaine?	Uh-huh.
What's wrong with making friends?	"You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make ""friends""."
Thank you very much.	When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.	You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...	And what, Sergeant?
Yes?	Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!	Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.	Number three.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.	Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.	Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.	He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
This pageant's like a roach motel.	Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.	Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Yeah, I guess.	Get some sleep.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...	Tell them I'm not.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!	Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.	That's lame, isn't it?
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.	Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
Who knows you have these?	Only you and the photo lab.
What the fuck possessed you?	You're the one who kept saying ram him.
How about a Big Mac?	Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?	Yes, Captain?
Is it?	Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Yes!	Why?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!	Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
I'm not in trouble.	Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!	Who the devil are you? What do you want?
What's this?	The main spire.
Why?	Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
What brings you out to the sticks?	Had a package to deliver.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.	I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.	Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
No... no...	I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.	Bene.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.	Oh?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...	... Will Perry ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...	... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
He's lying.	Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
We split 50-50?	Not likely, convict.
Why not? Half the house!	When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Don't!	Shut up!
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.	Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Not now, Elaine.	I mean until we start to burn up.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.	I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
What's the plan?	Plan?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?	One who's not a mutant.
Yes.	You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!	Okay. Great!
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?	That's right.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.	Don't say that.
I was at Beadles.	I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.	"I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a dress. A skirt or something."
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...	What? What could he do?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.	I can't...I can't find a shelter
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.	I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.	How fortunate.
Nobody.	Shit. You better tell me something.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.	Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
Let it go.	Did they tell you to sleep with me?
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.	The Day Care?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.	You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."	I was?
And what are we looking for?	I want to know about Treadstone.
Attractive girl.	Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Departmental policy.	You?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.	You don't own this man!
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?	You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.	I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Taffey Lewis?	Yes?
Huh?	Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.	Almost all of them.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
What is going to happen?	Frank is going to kill.
CONTINUED	She's wonderful.
Wrong answer --	We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'	A lot of people think like that.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.	What?
The debts.	And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?	No.
Well, how did it go? What happened?	Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...	Have you any place in mind?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?	Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.	Yes.
Why'd you come here, Brian?	"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.	And how do you feel about that?
Here we go.	Wait a second --
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.	But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
We tried!	You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?	Not entirely.
Sixteen 'C', why?	He's carrying a bomb.
Why?	He was, like, a total babe
Girl's gotta make a living.	Thank God.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.	Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
There seems to be no secret about that.	Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--	No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.	So I've heard.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?	I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!	Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
I should be better by now.	You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
I rest.	Your rest is making me exhausted.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.	Did you solve your problems?
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.	No it couldn't.
Come on. Harder.	I think I just broke my hand.
I don't know anything about it.	You could check. It'd be in his files.
I know all this.	Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Tough day?	Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.	How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
And the pennies?	New hitman wants to leave his mark
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?	Huh?
You know what I think?	What?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?	Well, yes.
Where is the key?	We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
What about the raping?	Shut up.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.	...Whaddo I do?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.	I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --	Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?	Why don't we ask him?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?	Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Who is he, his name?	"Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself ""Machine,"" that's what they call him.  Machine."
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.	Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.	Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?	Really?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.	The Old Lady by the swamp.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.	I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Then go get him.	That wouldn't be very sporting.
Well, I like it here.	I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!	SHHH!  Don't do that!
This has been a good year.	Jesse, we're outlaws.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.	Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.	What?
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?	"""Don?"""
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.	What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?	Let's get naked.
It's me.	You're fucking dead!
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?	Uh-uh.
Let me say somethin' first...	Why you got me chained?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.	Peter's brother?  But --
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.	You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?	Yes.
Oh yeah?	You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.	Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.	You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!	Oh, leave me alone.
He didn't recognize me.	It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
And so I am.	And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --	What the fuck are you doing?
Don't ask questions.	Fuck you!
Have him committed.	Yeah! That's thinking.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?	Damn straight!
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.	Then you don't wanna work hard?
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.	It was you, you shit.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.	How do you do, Mr. Rick?
"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""	The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...	Trust me to get the missionary.
How much is there?	Don't count it.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.	Here's to Ben.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Sam?	Yes.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.	You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...	That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.	You might be right.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.	Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.	That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Wah...?  Where are...?	Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Yes.	She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --	You've really got a problem.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?	You want my advice?
Patrick, you re a lunatic.	Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.	'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm sorry.	Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
We started over, you can too.	You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.	Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
She's my baby.	How long have you worked at the casino?
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
I found the Volvo.	Tickets?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?	Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
I guess we're not leaving, right?	I'm sorry, Newt.
That's me.	There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
What should I say?	Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.	"People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a ""laser.""  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the ""Ozone Layer."" Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom."
What was that?	Oh nothing.
You're sure it's Cyclops?	Take a look.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.	You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.	I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
I paid for it.	God DAMMIT.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?	Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.	Bastard...
Keep moving.	Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
That's it, prick lips.	What are you...
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!	Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Okay.	Fine.
Did you and Dad have any other property?	I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Yes, the money is good.	As a plumber?!
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.	Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
How do you know?	Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.	Yeah? When was the last time?
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-	Coffee?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.	When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
A hospital? What is it?	It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!	I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.	I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Jean?	Yes, Patrick?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.	I think you'd better.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?	How many?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?	"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?	A couple I know are getting married.
Doolittle! Help me.	Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Thank you.	He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.	He tried to warn us ...
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.	I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.	All except one. He won't have you.
I'm afraid so.	Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Vomit?	Faint.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.	My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Do you?	Yes indeed. I need protection.
Is that a serious offer?	I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
What do you want to do, Scott?	I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
What do you think?	He seems pretty good.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.	Thanks.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!	No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Away.	Your sister here?
His Grace is very angry with you.	What do you mean?
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?	No.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?	He understands.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?	What d'you mean?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out	So what's your excuse?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!	You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.	I like your stories.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.	Say again?  All after incinerators?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?	You're asking me why?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!	You ride like a Comanche.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.	Yes, sir.
I am listening, my son.	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I know what you did.	What?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.	Where will you find such a girl?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...	Jack is dead!
What's that?	Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.	And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Roger.	You can do it from up here, Captain.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.	You got a problem with drilling, probie?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.	Of course.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.	Exactly!
You're Anthony?	Yeah.
They've tricked us.	What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?	Gladly.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.	Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...	Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.	I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Anybody you think is evil?	Yes.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.	But how can I do that?
I hate peas.	No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
I think so.	Show me.
You really wrote this just today?	What're you implying.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.	I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep	I know, just let me sleep
He's sick.	For a change.
I'm here.	Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?	I love her.
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.	You couldn't?
"I'm glad I didn't ask you for ""Washington Crossing the Delaware""."	We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?
Where?	Here in Vienna.
Watch me.	You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
Maybe we should do something?	Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.	We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
Because I'm so horny.	God exists because you're horny.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.	What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?	What are you talking about, asshole?
Are you all right?	Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.	You're crazy --
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.	Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.	You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.	You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
You must believe me.	What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.	Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!	Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
What'd he say?	"""A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"""
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?	Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Is it a what?	Pull out.
You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.	Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Why do you do it?	I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?	Aw, shucks, ma'am...
That's easy enough.	I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?	You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
C'mere. I love you so much.	I love you much.
I don't know who I am.	Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?	Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Mommy, I'm scared.	There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
The key, Wade.	Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.	He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
What's your accomplishment.	I kill someone famous.
You remember Margie Fogg?	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?
So you think the dissertation will get published?	I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
And what?	Stop playing me Sloan.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...	Doesn't it get... Tiring?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?	No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --	-- Hello, Ilsa.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.	From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
After you cut her loose.	She walked.
The phone made me do it!	You've been having strange sex...!
wasn't anywhere near this place	Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Patrick?	Yes?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?	For you, anything.
How many others killed?	Nine.
What will I say when she comes to the door?	"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?	That young lady's size, right'cher.
Make it official, if you like.	What is your nationality?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...	Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?	Oh God, just get it over with.
Don't you watch the news?	I don't own a television.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.	Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
I despise the job.	Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
No.	Oh.
I guess.	One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.	I think perhaps you're right.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Surprise, Luther.	Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --	I miss you.
Are you crazy?	Don't worry!
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?	Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Management were pin heads.	"""Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards""?"
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?	Me?
If you get it?	Yeah.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.	How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Gerade aus dann links!	Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
We ended in F Major?	Yes.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.	What? What does he want?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.	Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!	Shut up.  Just shut up!
People just...disappear.	The earth just opens up and swallows people.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.	I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Good MORNING!	Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
No, not yet.	But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
I'm here, aren't I?	I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?	Yes, Daddy.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.	I don't want to be a martyr.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.	I keep the heat on.
How do you mean 'exploited'?	Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
"What ""magic""?"	I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...	Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
But I've seen her grave.	Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
There's ways around that.	Go find one.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...	Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Sorry.	Don't let it happen again.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?	Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Who?	I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.	I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Nothing.	Nothing?
Yeah?	Have you pulled yourself together?
Corn gonna shoot at me?	Nope.
Put your right foot there --	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
...yes.	Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.	Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?	I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Nothing.	Nothing?
Sorry. I didn't know...	Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
I don't understand.	Happy bath day.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.	What is Debbie's position?
We've got to disarm the bomb.	Doolittle, are you there?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!	Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money	Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Rick's got an important announcement to make.	Yeah. What is it?
It's enough isn't it?	What do you mean?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.	I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Yes, you do!	Or have perfect table manners.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.	Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
I don't gamble.	Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
How did it go?	Fine.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.	Yeah.
What about a drink on the way home?	I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
No.  Go ahead.	Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Busy	Were you in jail?
Good morning, John.	Good morning.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?	It's not history.
I didn't mean that, in life.	In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
The criminals are winning.	Is that why you say it's horrible?
Alex?	Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Nevertheless --	Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
What about the phosphorous grenade?	One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Be careful.	Of course, I'll be careful.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.	Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Watch this!	What?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.	Just a little.
What does he want?	He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.	What is it my son?
We should have seen land.	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
You what?	You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.	You're roommates?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?	Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
No.	How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Shall I read to you?	What? Oh, yes, please.
...We're saved!	I'm fucked!
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!	He's a fucking maniac!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!	Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.	So?  So?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.	Will you come with me?
Whatiya mean?	Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Yeah.	I'm going to wait here until she comes.
He did. Captain Renault did.	I thought so. Where's your husband?
I'm serious.	Shut up.  Look!
Who told you this, Majesty?	It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.	We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.	Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.	I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Thank-Q!	I thought only hookers drank those things.
"So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, ""You're fired! Your whole team's fired!"" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --"	But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.	Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Stall.	What do you want?
I've stopped a hundred times.	So how's Tommy?
Hmm.	"""Hmm"" what?"
He's carrying a bomb.	A b...
An evil vet?	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
It's okay, Stephen, I --	-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Oh yes! It was wonderful!	I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Nice to meet you.	And this is Manray.
Nothing.	Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
I get the picture.	Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Jeffrey.	Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?	Yes, very soon.
Rose.	Kitty...
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.	Okay. Do.
No...	Let's go.  Him first.
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --	-- You remember.
What have you ordered?	It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Of course not.	You could help us.
You better not, Jeffrey.	Okay, okay.
"No mo' ""city slickers.""  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?"	Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Patrick?	Can you bring Mr...
Loretta, don't do that.	I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I guess living up here makes people look older.	Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.	Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.	Your Highness.
About what?	The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?	I'm staying with the Countess.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.	Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?	Sure.  Just a minute.
Yes?	Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
How do you deal with --	WHAT?
What do you mean?	It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.	I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
No, not that.  How 'bout...	She hates dem.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.	Ring it for him, Sobo.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...	Bring the film, or we kill him.
Nothing. I'm fine.	You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
I remember once when your account checked.	Yeah.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.	So who was he with?
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.	That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Oh.	It was my decision, not his.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.	How do I leave here?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.	Has his friend appeared to him again?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
I can't write it!	Why not?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...	It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.	Oh yes? You always know everything.
Okay. I wish you could come.	This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
So what did I have an effect on ?	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
You're asking for my documents?	No, no...
Dr. Hirsch?	Go about your duties.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?	Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Yah?	Oh-you-beccha.
Where do you live?	You're not a stalker or anything, right?
No way.	Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Tell me what happened.	What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
What do you mean?	Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.	Not for me.
Yes.	Move him.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.	The District Marshall
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.	I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Good evening.	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.	Everybody shut up.
Now many?	Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.	What's that chain around her for?
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?	I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...	We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?	No.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.	What are you going to see?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.	I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?	Okay, okay. Bye.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.	No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
Nothing.	Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.	"I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say ""I love you"". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly."
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...	Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?	Yeah.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.	I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.	Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.	Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.	Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.	What if she never starts dating?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.	You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
What am I going to do?	You want to go talk to him?
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.	Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .	The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Carnies.	What?
A strange wang right in my palm.	Ilene, we don't really know that.
Yes, I am.	But what about the past? Our past?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.	I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...	We have met ...
Ahh, you'll miss me.	No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?	Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.	Did you try?
That doesn't bother you, does it?	Who, me? Why should it?
Hi there.	Hi.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?	Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.	Jack.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.	And?
Where's Czech girl?	Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
What do you want to know?	The good stuff.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.	So am I.
In the microwave.	Make anyone cry today?
You need to say a bit more than that!	Oh... er... yes...
I like what you've done with the place.	It's comin' along... want a beer?
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.	I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.	That's not a burn.
No.	Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Rick? Who's he?	Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?	Yeah.
I'm the victim here.	Really?
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.	Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
It smells funny. Like gasoline.	Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
You're late.	I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Bites what?	The big one!
My office.	For how long?
Why? Is this about the book?	No. Frank.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
He works for me.	Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.	I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.	Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Anywhere you want?	Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
You can believe that if you want to.	Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?	Am I a doctor, no, but...
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
1959.	Who use to own it?
No. You sure you're okay?	I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.	Hold on a sec, I got a call.
It's a lung cancer issue	Her favorite uncle
Like a man.	Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.	C'mon.  It's not that bad
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?	No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Same thing Giuliani said.	Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
What do you chant?	'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?	Nothing about you.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.	Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?	I thought you were punishing me.
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.	No kidding?
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.	Why are you doing this to me?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.	Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --	As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
You ever take a bath with a man before?	There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?	Nothing.
I need Il Duce.	The Duke?  What did you do?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.	Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Or what? You've gone round the bend --	West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?	You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.	I don't really know how --
I keep it for emergencies.	Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.	You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.	You will?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.	What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
"Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."	"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?"
Think they're alright?	Of course! I would've heard.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.	Hey, bomb.
I love you.	I love you.
Be careful.	Thanks.
William didn't even go to high school	That's never been proven
It's a sweep.  C'mon.	What?  Where're we going?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.	I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Okay.	So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...	I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.	Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!	Let go of me...
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.	Can you find her?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...	I will.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...	Okay, everybody, listen up!
What for?	Your work.
No.  Poached.  Over.	Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
It's just insurance.	That's what I'm talking about.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.	I feel sure of it.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!	Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.	Shut up.
So you killed him?	I...
I've continued working on the case!	I can see that.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.	Yeah, I read the report...
What makes you so sure?	It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Who is Pamela Landy?	You hear me? I believed you.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?	Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.	We'll find him, not to worry.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.	Maybe she's asleep.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.	Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?	Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?	We'll have to look for them later.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--	Hold on!
Mark...	I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.	Why? Is this about the book?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.	I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Jam, listen up.	Hawk?
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.	Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?	I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
Would you tell me why?	Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
There must be a way to fix this.	Fix?
This is so unfair.	That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Shot of vodka, please.	Thank you very much.
They go.	Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.	I tell you, I saw them!
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.	No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.	But now you can't go.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
When'd you start working here?	Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?	It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Shit!	Ss-ai!
With my money!	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.	I'm listening.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.	Low enough to relay internet traffic.
For what?	Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?	It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.	Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.	I have to get to Sugai.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...	Do you want to tell me what you found?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...	If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Okay. Goodbye.	Goodbye.
You DON'T like it, do you?	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
You think of everything, don't you?	And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Well, promise then.	What do you mean - now?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.	Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.	There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
How was it?	You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
And?	There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Come on in. What you been up to?	Not a whole lot, Bob.
Gal, you ain't right yet.	I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
And got well paid for it on both occasions.	The winning side would have paid you much better.
But I would like to buy you drink.	I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Have you taken leave of your senses?	I have. Sit down over there.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.	You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.	What reason?
Nick!	Give us a break...
Read.	"""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"""
These things are wild...  What do you think?	Makes you look like a nun--
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.	What happens if you level with her?
You can't talk about my brother like that...	Here we go...
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.	Don't even do it, ya bastard.
I've missed you.	Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Why?	Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.	What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.	You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.	Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.	That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
... death ...	Love...
I just want the job.	Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Where's luther?	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --	WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.	I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
That will do, Herr Mozart!	Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.	Am I bothering you?
No, that wasn't it...	Was it -- swine?
Really, Loretta?	You-betcha.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?	Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.	"Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!"
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...	You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
You sell it.	To who?
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.	Yeah? Why?
Did you decide on a runway yet?	Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Which one was that?	On the left.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?	All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...	How do you know?
And that's it?	Yes.
So you took off your shirt?	To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.	Goodbye.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.	Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
You couldn't?	You don't understand...
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.	I've never seen a lobster.
Is there something the matter with it?	Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?	His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
I AM one, Dad!	We haven't got a spare place.
No one.	I heard voices.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.	It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.	My goodness.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!	Uh, yes, you do.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?	Turn around.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?	Sir, yes, sir!
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.	I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I just don't like it.	What do you like then?
Hopeless. It's hopeless.	David, let's go now.
Chief, what the fuck is this?	Sweet-n-low!
No... it was a seven letter word.	Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
No!	Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.	Will you think about it?
-- Tonight he forgot.	Yes, I come, I will do it.
Is that all?	Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.	That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.	He treats you okay?
You were sublime.	What did you think of the music?
Yeah, you were saying?	Excuse me.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?	Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You cook very well!	And that I can drive a truck!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?	Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
We're fucked, I know --	They got their stories straight.
Then who shot him?	Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
What?	You're kidding.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Go on. Sit down.
Now I'm embarrassed.	Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?	Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Only one I can think of.	Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Because you killed one of my crew.	Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Jeremiah?	Yeah?
Like what?	Like...
I hope you're right.  I really do.	I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.	And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
What are you doing here?	I forgot some of my stuff.
Did you know? Had you heard?	What?
Yeah...	Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.	This is no good.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.	When? How?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.	That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Did you do it for Tim?	That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Yes...	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Got a pencil?	Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Yes.	Get out of here, Jack!
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.	It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.	One of  em's in the slam.
Yyess.	"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?	Yes.
What is?	I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
That's enough.	You can suck a fuck.
Who is she? Where does she live?	Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.	What else?
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.	Who killed Pike?
Who...	Ross.
You are a fanatic.	'Gonna wait outside.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.	Absolutely.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.	"...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a ""system."" ""Losers,"" who played games of chance. He could ""read"" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again."
Five bills.	Five.  On credit.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?	Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Any I.D.?	Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.	Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
How old is Grandma Death?	A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
You guys?	We're here brother.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.	I try to be.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?	I just wanted some make-up.
Do you?	Yes.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.	Good.
I know.	I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
What's baseball?	It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Why?	Because it is my duty.
I don't want to be a martyr.	Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
What do you mean?	It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
The sky?  Where?	Up there!!
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.	Are you neglecting my request?
Are you absolutely sure?	I've seen the manuscript.
Give us a break...	It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?	Not really.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.	That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.	I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.	So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Okay?	Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.	Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Don't you have any leads at all?	No Marty, I don't.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?	She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
How many questions did it take?	Thirteen.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.	Honey, I'm not, please...
They're harder to do than they look.	Oh?  You've tried?
I have a family, Mary.	You made me have an abortion.
You don't understand...	No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?	No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?	You're right. We should sit in silence.
Like silk?	God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.	But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.	What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.	I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?	Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.	Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...	Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.	By who?
There are two bodies found at this point.	Can we go up to the crime scene?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -	- for horrors like yourself?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.	Duck, here they come.
Where?	It's a secret.
You wanted to break him.	Yeah.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.	Our mother can see through bags.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
What's happening? What's going on?	It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
You think we're going to be chased?	That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?	Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
But Marcus denied it?	Yes.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.	I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.	Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Brian?	Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.	I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?	First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
You're nothing but a... a...	The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.	I haven't got it.
You're a thief?	Girl's gotta make a living.
Daddy, she's younger than me.	My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.	Are we hacking or asking?
This must be very new.	Yeah.
Dad.	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
In the other man's rectum.	Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.	How much time does he have left?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?	Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.	Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
You -- covered in my vomit.	Seven-thirty?
Yes.	I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Shepherd.	Sir...
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.	Could you give us a moment.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?	No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
You really scared me, you shithead.	Are you going to help me up?
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Simon, why has he become so... so...	So mentally ill?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?	What do you mean, help?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.	It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Well... I did.	We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Follow him where?	Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?	Full clip to the body --
Two days?	After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Yeah, I noticed...	Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Yeah.	This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Where are my goddamn books?	Books?
Three, maybe more!	Armed?
Well, do we just go on up?!	No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
What's your name?	My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And I with you. But you must wake.	I need you so much! I love you!
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?	I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
The Fifth Element...	Take them and put them in a safe place.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.	Certainly, sir.
So, what's next?	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
But! I'm a married woman!	Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Man, you're losing your audience.	Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.	You called the casino a cesspit.
Love...	"Yes! But ""love"" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!"
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.	Of course. Please have a seat.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.	It's makes it easier. Okay.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...	I'd like this cashed, please.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.	Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.	Humbly, M'lord.
I have a good crew.	Minus one.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.	He succeeded.
Hi.	What do you want, Stan?
I like it.	Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.	Your Excellency!
We're doing this for Ma.	Maybe it started out that way. But now...
I don't know.	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Really? Because --	Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
What's that?	It's just my heart.
Mademoiselle.	Mademoiselle.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.	Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I do. I want to very badly.	So you're just going to be vindictive
Milo?	Don't we have any chopsticks?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.	No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.	You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.	It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?	Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
For what?	That's gonna stay my secret.
Merrick...	"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?	He's asleep. We were up very late.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?	Yes, it is, Hal.
Joely...	Yeah, Tangerine?
You were expecting me?	Not yet.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL	Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?	I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.	Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
No.	He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
You've been here before?	Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
Yes... ?	Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.	We'll be there.
I want to sleep... forever...	Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.	You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?	Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
And the problem is you only got three.	No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
It's you, David.	What?!
The case..with the stones... Where is it?	San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
How'd they --	What have you done?
No. I --	I know a man who needs a refill.
Why don't you have more time?	Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
No.	I thought your parents were in Italy.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?	Tumescent!
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.	I didn't mean that, in life.
Hey Murph.	Roc. You okay?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.	Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.	Those sluts!
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.	Let's grab some food.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.	Great, just great.
Where've you been?	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
So what?	Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
And you live in this building all by yourself?	Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!	Where's Mandalay?
Here...use a spoon.	Leave me alone, Marion.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?	Well, you can't always get what you want.
It belongs to Pop.	Pop?
But	Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
"Last year? It was, ""Buy American."""	And the year before that?
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?	No.
Hy-Brasil?	Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I'm proud of you.	Why?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.	What do you think the cops have?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
What is wrong with you?	I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...	You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Get up.	Feels so good to lie here.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.	Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.	No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
They loved you.  And I killed them.	How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
me up the...	Ass!
What did you wish for, Adam?	If he tells, it won't come true!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.	...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Yes, I think I can.	No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Seriously?	Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Hi, Joey.	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Tomorrow?	Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Hey, Halberstam?	Yes, Owen?
Of course.	Good.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.	What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.	That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
If he tells, it won't come true!	Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.	No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
I must only let the red rage...	You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.	Why?
But he's all right?	Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.	She likes you okay.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.	Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.	How much?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?	Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?	Yes, sir.
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..	What is... Make Love?
This was in fourth grade.	Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Any ideas?	Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Mel Gordon.	I still don't understand --
Did I say that?	You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.	Hello, daddy.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?	Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Roc. You okay?	Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Yeah...	And the bite marks on my ears?
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.	Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.	So?
I'm sorry.	I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Does this person have a name?	Lydia.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.	Ah! By all means.
Speak.	He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
It couldn't be simpler.	First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
I talked with your father last night.	Did you?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.	If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.	If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
He mentions Homer, too, you know.	"Wally said to say, ""Hello."""
Dead.	How many others killed?
Treason. Against whom?	Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
"All right, say ""Airport Ho-Jo."""	Airport Ho-Jo!
What?	I'm too young to be so sick.
Can I put it in your mouth?	Okay.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?	A real turd.
I've got you!	You'll be sucked down too!
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --	You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?	I just got in.
Can't lock up...	Talk to me, Hudson.
-- He killed people --	-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.	Funny.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...	How do you know that?
As you see.	Then you can't come in.
Where's that guy going?	He left his sweater.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.	... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.	What'd you do?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?	Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
That bugs you too?	Little bit.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.	Well, anyway... Sorry.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...	Stop it. This is just sad.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.	Will Bogey get bent?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.	Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
You see it?	Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Can --?	Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
It's not mine.	It's not mine either.
You don't?	No. What is happening?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?	Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --	Bullshit.
Right.	I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Then what?	I killed them.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?	Bambi?
It's very small.	Big enough.
I can't stop thinking about you.	Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?	Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Would you guys...	No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.	Hey, how are you?
Certainly.	Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.	Can I see your back?
Nah.	Want company?
And because he's my friend.	Friends don't help other friends cheat.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?	Energy shielding positive function.
Rose Rose?	Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.	No water, no work.
Ten percent. Of how much?	Two million.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.	Is Callie still around?
He -- He made me do it --	Do what?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...	Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.	You sure? That doesn't sound --
What?	Musta got some primo bondsman.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.	Amazing. I'm very impressed.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.	Nah, why should you?
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.	Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Chief - mind if I take her?	Okay.  But not water sports.
Armed.	Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
But I-- .	I'll handle it.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.	Mr. Williams . . .
Let's get out of here.	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?	I didn't. Mother did.
"That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse."	What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Where's the plow?	Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Oh. Oh.	Hello.
I have to disagree.	I knew you would.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...	I don't love ya no more.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...	Of course. I planned that, too.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.	Yes, sir.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.	I know.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.	...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.	You must have been crazy.
Lemme get my coat.	The one you're wearing?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.	Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Good day...!	I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?	I got a lot to protect.
I'm twenty-seven.	I know.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Tell him to put his gun down!	Let her go!  Let her go!!
It's almost like flying.	What about the trees?
What about a summary then.	I think we're through for the night.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.	Are we getting married?
What do people do in the afternoon?	If they are smart, they take naps.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?	The very same.
Hey Jack, join us.	No thanks.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.	This is terrible!
Then what?	We came back to the house!
Twombley.	No shit.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.	Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Hey, what'd you do that for?	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Where is he now?	In Mr. Sampson's office.
Right... What's that mean again?	Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.	Thank you!
*You* taught her, I suppose...	That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	Okay. Yeah. What time?
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Good morning. How's it going?	Are you reasonably awake?
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...	She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Then why go there?	Because he must!
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.	Yeah boss?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!	Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.	You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Yes, sir.	Of course!
Do you like this, Salieri?	It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
The wrong place?	The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Really?	As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.	Yeah.
All right!	When do the girls get to the party?
What are you talking about?	I just think you used to be bad.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.	Yeah, sure, I understand.
Why not?	It's a secret.
That's it.	Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
How do you mean?	Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.	So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.	I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.	There ya go.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.	But my sleeping is really fucked up.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.	Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
I'll let you know what happens.	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?	The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Yup.	Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Don't worry about it.	It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.	But I might not have.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.	I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.	Who gives a fuck what you think?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.	No, please.
No, he's really evil.	Scott.
I'm sorry.	Why?
Beautiful.	Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.	"Your Zee? Hmm.  ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."""
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?	That's what I'm sensing.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.	What you did is dead wrong.
May I help you, madam ...	Mr. John Steed, please.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?	If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Oh...	I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.	What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
I don't understand.	She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Hmmm ...	Looks like rain, Steed...
Where?	Behind Bob's house.
Oh God, I can't believe this.	I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
"""My dear""..."	"That's not right yet... put back ""President"" and take out ""dear""... How does it read now?"
To find out who killed my husband.	The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?	Please allow me to demonstrate.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.	You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?	Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.	What flickering light?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.	I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --	Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.	My answer is no, Mozart.
I don't have time... I need to know.	Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Detective, does it look like a murder?	We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
I, uh.	I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.	That's fine, Stan.
Tell me about it.	About...
Let me drive you home.	Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
What?	Where's my cat?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --	Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.	That depends on the man.
There was something. It happened up your way.	Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.	I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.	Two of us might be more effective than one.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.	I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
"The exercise was one of his Section Eight ""private sessions"". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning."	And the problem is you only got three.
Where are we going, Donald?	I have the power to build a time machine.
Sorry.	It's okay.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?	Don't think that'd be wise.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
It's dark.	Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.	Two weeks?
He wants the money from your bank.	I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?	Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.	Okay.
Where are we going?	We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?	Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
What?	I miss you. And I miss her.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.	What does that mean?
What happened?	They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.	How do I know you didn't?
Where'd you get all these riders?	We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.	In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Yes, Patrick?	Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
When will he be home, Major?	Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.	How well are you trained in music?
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.	There's no rule!
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.	You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Are you ill?	The doctor thinks I am. But -
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?	How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!	It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.	But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.	And you still think you can do something to change that.
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.	Okay...
Yes, it is.	Gee-ma-nee!
Money?	No.  I got a problem.
Yeah, Tangerine?	Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
We've got to take this slow...	Right, slow...
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.	Oh, damn!
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.	Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.	I don't have a story.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.	Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.	Rockville Center.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.	You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.	Some other time.
I'll let you know the next full moon.	You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.	It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Why don't you call him?	For what?  He left.  Not me.
You been with a girl ever?	Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
We were close to something with Kendall.	Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.	Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.	Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...	You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!	No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Hello, Benjamin.	No.
This gonna get you in trouble?	Not if no one finds out.
It's not history.	So what do you want?
Got it.	How's our deal coming along?
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
What's fair?	I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Well, these things take time.	I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.	Well...
Yeah.	It's an esoteric journey.
Um --	Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?	I... I was playing with fire.
Rick?	He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.	He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
No. Thanks.	My car's in the garage.
Well, no...	Then that's all you had to say.
I have to explore the mainland.	This time with me!
It'll be the biggest score yet.	What will be?
Where is she?	I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.	Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.	Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?	Just sent 'em through.
What's your bartlett's?	It's a quote book.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.	People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?	Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?	Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Shouldn't we tell Homer?	If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --	Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!	Not if I shoot first!
Just girls. What are you drinking?	Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.	German!
How long has this man been here?	Three quarters of an hour.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!	All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
I can't stand it.	So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.	And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.	But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.	Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
It works.	It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.	Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
You get half mine and I get half yours.	I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.	Yes, sir.
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?	Yeah.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.	Photos?
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.	Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.	Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?	Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...	Gambling's not about money.
Did you feel that?	Yes I did...
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.	I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.	Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Do it.	Don't think I won't.
The result would be ...	Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
What a screw-up.	Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Maestro.	Good morning.
I have something to tell you.	Lay it on me.
Yes... oh, yes...	Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""	"""Devil"" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite."
You will?	Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
Very impressive.	We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.	So now you're bummin' around?
Oh, that would be wonderful!	Well, we're here to help!
I want him.	He'll be dealt with.
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.	What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Future Man.	Who?
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.	I don't work for them, either.
Maybe it had something to do.	Shit!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.	Yes.  Well... yes.
Did you get the case for the securities?	Yes, sir.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
What about friends?	I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Peerless, your father called.	I'll be right over.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.	Yale thing?
About what?	You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Oh no, I'm okay.	It's no problem
Any other vices?	All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.	You are. And I'll come again.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --	Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.	We hope!
A Fender Strat. You bought this?	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...	I want to sleep... forever...
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.	So we go to the bar.
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?	Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?	It will be okay.
More than anything in the world.	And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Then why'd you ask?	Why'd you lie?
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.	Only too well... here you must be parched..
Keep painting.  Promise me.	Sure.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.	Bianca did what?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?	'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Where'd they come from?	The front stairs.
I don't remember.	Oh -- you mean... worm?
Doesn't he live here?	No, he doesn't.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.	He's been full of vinegar lately.
Did we warn them off?	Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
How close are you?	What?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?	Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.	Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
There.	Where?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --	What kind of trouble are you in?
Why not?	Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I swear.	Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Yes...	Call for help.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.	Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
That young lady's size, right'cher.	Well, that makes it easier.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...	I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
You're a policeman.	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.	The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.	So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
And I'm in control of it.	But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
I assume full responsibility.	Okay.
He's after your money.	You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Thank you, Daddy.	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.	I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
He's not Army, it's not official --	Then it's unofficial.
He was here?	He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He's smiling.	Never a good thing.
Right. Just a sec.	Okay.
I didn't kill him --	Then who did?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...	"""In her dream""?"
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.	Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.	"Don't you mean ""don't need no liquor license not taken away from me""?"
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.	It doesn't matter.
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.
So you were never a prostitute?	What are you asking me?
I told you not to read all that crap!	Protect life... Until death.
Ah!	A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.	I'm so excited, Simon.
Just how serious is it, doctor?	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.	Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Hello, luv.	Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.	I'll go up.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --	I'm serious --
What?	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Damn straight we are.	Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
And the third one?	You're the only one left alive...
Here's to. An interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
You tell that to them!	You're right.  Let the men decide.
Does it matter?	"If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."""
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.	What was she running from?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!	Cheers.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.	And? What are you saying?
No, not really.	Interesting.
You considered becoming a prostitute?	Yes, I considered it.
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?	Got it...
It was stolen!	Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
I'll...	Go.
They're no friends of mine.	Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.	You gonna miss your bus.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.	I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Because he'd shot Mueller.	But you didn't see it, right?
Then you have some hot tea?	No.
I apologize --	You saw West's body.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?	I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
He's pretty tight with his family.	We could move 'em up here.
What's normal?	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.	I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.	This night is too beautiful to have again.
Why, Cyril, you're insane	No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.	Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Oh, yes.	I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.	Until it withers away.
You know how to fly this thing?	It's like a cab isn't it?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.	And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Rule of thumb?	Yeah?
Yes, Sir!	Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?	Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...	I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
What time did he say to be here?	Right now.
Thank you, Miss -- ?	Lyla Devereux.
What guys do.  'Nother order.	You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.	And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Sometimes I think I do.	And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Well . . . ?	Well, he was making love to her.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.	And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.	My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.	Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.	All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	See you soon.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.	Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Shit.	I told you, use less powder.
Well.... er...	Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.	Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sunday, but...	Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
But, Eve, I would--	And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
What plan?	The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.	No. I thought about this, Mr.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!	He's my collar!
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?	Uh, no. There's one...down here.
What?	"Seven guys. What was it you said? You were ""just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said""."
Laz... You can't say nothin'...	If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.	Twombley involved?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.	I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?	Just catch the son of a bitch.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.	Poor baby. You know that's not true.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.	EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?	As per mother's instructions.
I am butcher.	You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?	You're so romantic...
Should we say a little prayer first?	Just open the door.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?	Uh-uh.
Oooooo.	Right in there, pal.
Mr. Rose *knows*?	He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Really.	You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Have you enlisted?	They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
I know.	What do we do?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.	I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...	Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
How many?	Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?	Not particularly.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.	What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
What is it?	Just get in the car, Bob.
Fine, I will.	Fine, you do it.
You have to stop this!	What? What do you mean?
You know what I mean	No.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.	Work related or otherwise?
What do you have, Danny?	You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Is *your* father dead?	Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
You can change it if you want to.	I don't know why we have to watch TV.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --	I fail to see --
Sure, what is it?	Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Whatcha doin'?	You scared me.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?	Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Well, that depends...	I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...	Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
This the right place?	I hope not.
Sounds like you, Hicks.	The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.	See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I can't do it...	Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That is none of your business.	Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Is this your house?	Yes!
Girlfriend?	One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.	I'm not at the hotel!
You sure you don't want a ride to work?	It's just across the park.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?	What?
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?	What?
Jean? Hello? Jean?	Patrick? Is that you?
You know I'm not.	YOU'RE A LIAR!
No, I mean whereabouts.	A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Out where?	Veil nebula.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.	I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Different? How?	Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.	I don't know.
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...	I was doing it for them.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?	I haven't any.
"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."	So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.	I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
You haven't heard my offer.	It's not for sale at any price.
Why are you here, then?	Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.	The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I'm sorry?	My meat and two veg.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.	Uh-huh.
And Mademoiselle?	You needn't be concerned about me.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.	No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?	No.
Again.	Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Shut up, you zombie!	I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.	I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!	He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
Come again?	Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.	That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.	Will it track back to us?
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.	That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
New worlds create new people.	Oh?  So you are a new man?
No, after you.	You don't trust me?
One guy do all the damage?	Yeah.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.	Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I mean for Ted.	You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.	Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
'Fraid so.	Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.	Oh, I'd love to.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?	Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.	Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
My folks are.	Stay here.
What...?  Do I have so many already?	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
We paid attention in school.	Know any other languages?
What are you doing here?	I wanted to see you.
Why me?	They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.	I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!	Oh, is that so?
I just don't see it.	Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.	Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
But you must have something to go on?	If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.	Perhaps.
No, please! I beg you ...	Walk over to the window ...
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?	What exactly are you working on?
That's what you think.	You swine!
Patrick? Is that you?	No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
It's a plain end. I think.	Turn the light on.
Why not?	Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.	"""We're"" not over-reacting."
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?	Today? Started off great...
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.	What are you talking about?
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...	I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?	I certainly do!
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...	Alright, I get the picture.
No...	No?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.	It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.	How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
I'm not positive this means anything.	The checks were for odd amounts...
It's none of your business.	Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?	Tower, here.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.	Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Which is none of your business...or mine.	It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.	Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.	Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.	Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.	I'm trying to quit.
Hold me, Don.	Don? Where is he?
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?	Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.	Oh.
I didn't --	But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.	Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.	That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.	Who's this?
Dorsey.	I hate him.
I can't!  Do you mind!	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
He's a she!	You noticed...
I *know* this was right.	Right.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.	Wolfi.
Yeah, how did you know?	I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
How you sound?	I won't do it anymore.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.	How old are you?
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.	"Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all ""re-enter"" the concerto. Voila!"
What was his name?	Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Did I have anything to say about it?	Absolutely not.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.	Well, not me personally.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.	I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
The other one like you...	You lost me.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.	I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.	I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
A little what?	You know what I'm saying.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!	Why?
It's a secret.	Fine. I'll just wait here.
He's setting that play to music?	Yes.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.	He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.	Come up here a minute.
Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
Do I have a choice in this?	Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.	Maybe we should all get on it.
What?	These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
"The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, ""F"" 'em."	We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
You feelin' sick?	I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
We are totally booked.	Oh really? That's great.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.	Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Too early to tell.	How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	The one and only Little Richard.
What's this?  What's going on?	Nothing.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?	No. I think I better just go.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?	It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
She likes you okay.	I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
Welcome home.	Do you know how much I missed you?
We just want --	"What, ""The Truth""? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem."
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?	Cute, Evan.
Esdras is a Jew.	So was Christ!
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?	I don't know.
Well.	THEN WHAT?
You did not ask me.	I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
What is it?	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.	That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.	No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?	Yes, sir.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!	It is suicide.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?	Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Bene.	I'll call tomorrow.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...	The what man?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!	Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.	I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Pike, please --	Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.	So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.	It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.	Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
What do you mean?	You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.	I don't have to. I've got them right here.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.	I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
I'll give it my best shot.	Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.	Wait. That's not what I've got.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?	York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!	Mozart -
KILL! KILL!	Stop it!
Lung cancer?	Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!	Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --	Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Sure I'm alright.	I'll go then.
Humiliated?	How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Oh shit!	They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.	He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Okay, okay.	Goodnight.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?	We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!	Then why go there?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.	Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.	What's in it for you?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.	You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.	Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.	And this is my very best friend Mantan.
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?	Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.	Man, you are one chilly square!
Let me take the lead, Stephen...	Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
But how...?	He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
He said that?	Yes he did.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.	I know. I had to take the day to think.
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
Give him a second.	Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
No... no... no...	They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...	I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
CONINUED	Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?	Come again?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.	Yeah?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?	No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.	Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.	Alright, cut, cut, cut.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.	Sure, I think it's swell.
What about her?	Well, do you still plan to get married?
Wasn't that hard.	Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
I must KILL! Kill!	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.	Here, use mine.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.	Do you mean that?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.	I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Practically no one.	If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So they tell me...	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.	I'll stop him... You stall him.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?	No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
I am one lucky guy.	Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.	I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.	Is he working?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?	You were little Jesse James when you left.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?	Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?	What?
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.	"Well, your ""cheap whore"" is this family's ""lovin' mother.""  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and..."
Yes?	Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?	No, Daddy.
Why do you care?	Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...	Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Still a bit chilly ...	English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!	You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!	I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Like what?	Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
What was that all about?	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Your life will never be the same.	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.	You cannot say that!
And I thought you were only after my body.	I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
I remember.	After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!	What???
I don't know... I like the Army.	C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Zee.	Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Stop it. I'm...	On a lot of lithium?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.	I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Ho! Ho! Ho!	Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?	I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Yes, Sire.	Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.	No, but I'm the best.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.	Of what sort?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.	How 'bout...
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.	Nobody goes there anymore.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?	I'm a toy to her.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.	What ten thousand pounds?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.	I want to go home.
And that I can drive a truck!	Better than I can!
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.	He's after your money.
Sometimes.	Sometimes which?
Is the Emperor angry with me?	On the contrary.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.	Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Where'd Twombley get shot?	In the chest.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.	Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...	I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Don't come back.	I won't...don't worry.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.	Scott, don't say that...
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.	Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
You got in the car, didn't you?	Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Then forget it.	No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Well, of course he is!	Sh!
Can I get that credit card from you?	I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.	That's a good one.
...Yes potatoes... but...	But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.	Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
No what?	No, I won't go with you
You can do it from up here, Captain.	I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.	So?
Let them fight.	Let them fight.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
And that is?	You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.	My father is a genius.
You're pointing a gun at me.	Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.	Won't you join us for a drink?
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!	Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
What the fuck do you mean?	I mean he ain't here.
Do you remember the detonation time?	Detonation in twenty minutes.
What's to believe?	That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
She's going to divorce me.	George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Good morning, sir.	What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Hi Ma...	I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Whatever.	I'm sorry.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.	I don't want to talk about it.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.	What about his teeth?
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!	Fuck you!
I don't want you for a friend.	Why not?
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.	I could easily arrange...
Who's going to die?	Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?	They said he's a drug dealer.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	I'm sorry, honey.
How are you feeling, Fernando?	Not bad.
Screw you.	Screw me?  That can't be right.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.	Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...	Easy Sketchy.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?	Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Nor I!	But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.	...Were you?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.	Then I demand an apology!
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!	You sure you killed them?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.	This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
You understand?	Why, of course.
Let's just slow down for a second...	You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.	I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?	I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Yes.	Good.
Is she not here?	I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.	If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?	Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...	Was I?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.	I'm here with you.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.	I don't want to leave.
Can we go up to the crime scene?	You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
How do you do?	Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Damn skippy.	You're in this up till ya neck.
Everything looks in order.	This has to happen fast.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?	I, uh.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.	Did you learn anything?
Shit, that dork is Jam.	YO, DOOFUS!
You son of a bitch.	Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Yes!	If I...you know...
"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"	I thought you were above all that
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?	Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
I did?	Yeah, you did!
Over my dead body.	No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
I'm asking what you're here for.	What?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?	Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.	THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Really?	Really. You want to dance with someone else?
No, I'm not.	You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Go about your duties.	Yes, Doctor.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!	You had my help, detective.
How do I stop one?	Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Finished what?	Learning language.
"It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a ""personal consultation"" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!"	What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.	He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?	Not bad.
He did?	Yeah.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.	Lighten up.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.	So we got a plan?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.	I don't give a shit who you ask.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.	I know.
Bull.	Alright, suit yourself.
I believe they will deport you.	I have faced that problem before.
Yes, I am looking after him.	Can we come in?
Of course they were. How many?	Three.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.	If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.	Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.	For what?
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Locked.	Stand back.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
What are you doing?	Flying the plane.
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...	No...
Likewise.	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.	The king can do to wrong!
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.	Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.	Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
TALBY!	Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.	But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...	There's not much illegal.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.	Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?	No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.	Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!	I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!	Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
You okay?	A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Negative effect.	It didn't work?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?	Great, yes, I'd like that.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.	Wine?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?	The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.	The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Jesus... Take it easy.	No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --	Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
...When did you know?	You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?	I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Prosit.	Prosit.
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!	GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.	Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
What was I wearing?	God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?	Yes.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.	Why don't you get undressed.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...	That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Anything you can tell me?	The criminals are winning.
What? Oh, yes, please.	A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
I didn't mean to...	You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?	...I learned a long time ago.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.	Why not?
What happened?	Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.	No. I wasn't adopted.
Pardon me?	My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Okay... well, bye.	Bye.
What the hell was that all about?	I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Leave my daughter alone.	Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.	And for you --
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.	Really! That's wonderful.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.	You can tell a man by his friends.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?	Yes.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.	When?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.	You don't understand anything.
I'm feeling fine this morning.	That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
HOW MUCH TIME?	PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Those are her belongings.	Her belongings?
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.	Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.	Guess I'm on a roll.
Right.	Kat a fan, too?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.	He sure as hell won't.
What's wrong with you?	What do you mean?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!	"Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not ""Taxi Driver."" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and..."
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?	Sure.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.	I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.	Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
What? What is it?	This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.	Oh. So...
Do you know what C.P. Time is?	C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
Uh-huh.	What's a long time?
-- open circuit breakers --	-- remove thrust drive repellant --
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.	And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Are you sure?	Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.	Why?!
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.	I called Mommy.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?	That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
We can't wait to be sure.	I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.	Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.	May I please be excused?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?	No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Yes?	Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Will you go with me?	Where are we going?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?	I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...	She had this in her mouth. There, there...
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?	We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I don't know... I think I missed something.	Like?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.	Why, Cyril, you're insane
Roberto, what the fuck?	We just want to check your pack --
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?	I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Indeed.	These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.	Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.	You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.	Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.	I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...	You mean you could use it.
I have the power to build a time machine.	How is that possible?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?	Would they do that?
She says she has a secret to tell.	What?
Sorry.	Jean? What?
You don't know what you're getting into here.	And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.	For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
We should do it.	No-I can't take the time off work.
What are you going to do?	We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.	But, mom!
What's he doing?	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...	I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.	Had kind of a long night.
Ever?	I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...	Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.	I know. Stop it.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.	Does that scare you?
Felt a little light.	Drop it.
"""My dear""..."	"You can't say that to the President... Put back ""President""... Now let's hear how sounds."
Recommendations.	My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Yep.	How did this happen?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.	I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.	It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?	Not just a patient -- me.
Don't care.	Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?	My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
The... The funny man.	The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...	It claims to restore monthly regularity.
If I go.	If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Everything OK?	Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
We need to talk.	Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
I'll see you there.	What?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?	I told you, all bets are off.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.	Any time, Al.
I don't know. You tell me.	Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Wait... He knows.	What?
Let her go.	First, the money.
Line?	Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
What is wrong with you?	In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.	There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...	For your own sake... For the others... I...
What was she running from?	I don't know.
Well, where are you --	Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
*                     Please tell me your name.	Maria... Maria Mitchell.
I want Debbie.	Cole...
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?	I don't know.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.	Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.	Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.	Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.	Thanks, Valentine ...
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.	You better check it, Unger.
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.
But you're my father -	Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
So you got cozy with she who stings?	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.	I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
Your ranch?	Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.	My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Answer the question, Patrick	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
This is a remarkable aircraft.	You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.	I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.	Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.	What's the other?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.	I know.
How do we know this is the way?	We blew the Horn Resounding.
You're Chuck Noland.	Yeah.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.	"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
Jack, we'd better go.	What do you mean? I'm starving.
What happened? Is it over?	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.	They'll be up there in a half hour.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.	I'll be back at 9:00.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.	You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Mmm.	Mmm, what?
Longer.	I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Thanks.	I thought it was appropiate.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.	No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Faster!	Make your mind up.
Yeah.	Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.	why did they do that?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.	Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.	Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.	Does he do this all the time?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.	Not the happiest of memories?
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.	Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?	I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.	You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.	*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?	Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Fuck you.	That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?	Of course.
During the road test...	Yeah?
And what, Sergeant?	I don't rightly know, sir.
Where?	Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.	Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Dignan, it's got an alarm.	I don't think so. Just reach on in.
My wedding tackle.	I'm sorry?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.	Sure... I'll see you around.
Cellar door.	Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.	There's no choice.
What are you asking me?	I'm just trying to find out who you are.
Inspector.	Alderman.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?	The American? Yes, duck.
Here we go again...	You know women normally change five times more than men.
Oh, yes.	You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.	Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Yes, where?	In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.	Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
That coward. Son of a bitch.	Maybe he just went to the store.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.	Debbie Klein cried a lot.
That's not a burn.	It is. I did it cooking.
It's me.	Bourne?
Right <u>at</u> him?	That's what I said!
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?	No.
You could train someone else.	Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
You okay, Rose?	I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
NO.	Let's wait for some slow one.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap	Dr. Ruth?
I'm working on it.	Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
End my career?	How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...	I'm marrying Debbie.
When do you need her by?	Two weeks.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.	Moon's too bright.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?	Richard, I had to see you.
Mrs. Peel?	What kept you?
Ss'kya'ta'.	What's that?
What are you doing here?	You've got a call.
Yes, Monsieur.	And you want to know --
What?!	I said, I'm sorry!
You can see why it's sensitive?	Uh... Yes.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.	Aye, we'll get 'em.
That oughta do it.	Yeah.
Well, you obviously don't know me.	I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!	Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!	Oh?
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.	A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?	Tomorrow night?
No.	Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...	That's not right, really, cuz I...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.	So am I.
My... name is...	John Merrick.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --	Get your hands away from the desk!
Is that Nietzsche?	Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
That's odd...	What?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?	Money! Money!
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.	Give me the gun.
Answer it.	Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Didn't think you'd make it.	Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
What are you talking about?	I'll get him.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?	I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
But how can I do that?	If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
So, just how big was this fare?	"5'7"", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.."
What?	I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Why's that?	Long story. Not that interesting.
Charlie!	Yeah?
Got it.	Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.	Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway	I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
When can I squeeze one out?	Not until like... eighth grade.
It shuts off automatically.	Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
That where Anderson worked?	Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.	Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.	He's got a point.
This is -- what?	Enid ate a whole pan!
I forgive you.	Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
And where're you going?	If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
I'm a mirror.	Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
I think you should go.	You do?
Shut up.	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
You're protecting somebody.	No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Heineken.	FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
I don't think so.	Coward!
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.	Sure.
You don't even know me.	I have the rest of my life to find out.
You framed-him...	None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?	Yes.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.	How's that? He works for Gillette.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.	He has already agreed to come.
Do you believe in astrology?	Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?	It's crossed my mind from time to time.
He's asleep.	You didn't...
Why?	I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I had you covered.  From back there.	Shit.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.	I haven't read that.
You and...Luis?	We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Well...	John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Yes, dear!	As long as we've got that straight.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.	Is he all right, papa?
Do you mean that?	I do.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.	Well... I did.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.	"Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on ""Page Six"" at least."
Yes, Eve?	I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Very much.	This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?	So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Yes.  A little girl.	Where is she?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.	I'll think about it.
Okay.	Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Mr. Nevins?	Who's this?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.	Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
I don't know.	Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!	"""An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."""
I told you they were there.	So it's my fault?
I'll be all right.	You're my brave boy.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?	Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!	So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.	Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...	Like I said: shot in the dark.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?	Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Special Agent?	You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
A gift.	For what?
"I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, ""I'm going to remember you!"""	That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!	There IS no one.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.	I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.	Gertrude!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.	You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...	It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...	I didn't mean to...
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.	Where do you go from here?
The fat man.	Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.	I don't know.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!	Don't you FEEL it?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'	No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
The locks.	The locks?
"That's the guy that got us off the hook with the ""Checkov"" thing."	And he is one smart man.
There must be another way!	I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.	Please don't go.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?	Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
We was robbed.	It's okay.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.	That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
It's not?	You gotta push the little yellow button...
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.	You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Nothing remotely like this.	I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.	What's on your mind?
Wait a minute...	No, forget it. The bet's off.
Only if you can afford it.	Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Binoculars.	Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.	Why did you quit?
"""Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.""  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis."	Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Oh, thank you, sir.	Do any pupils come to the house?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...	The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.	Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --	I remember.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?	I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!	You burned the score?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.	Don't be too long.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.	Theo's dead.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.	I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
These aren't just...	I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.	You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
You scare me.	I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?	Bah!!
I'm going home	Let's go, Jake?
I know it's a dream.	You do?
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?	Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.	Even in Berlin.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?	That's your job.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.	Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
What?	A hundred bucks a date.
With your help.	Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.	Finish what?
Okay.	Yeah? Oh, great!
I'm going completely crazy.	David!
It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...	Don't.  We've had a hard night.
May I ask, where are you bound?	San Francisco.  And you?
Hands off your hip, Cole.	You're not scared, are you?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.	Thank you.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.	Enchanted, Madame.
No.	Just wondering.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.	I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Some kids were teasing you?	That's not really the point.
Silicon Valley?	That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.	But Richard, no, I, I --
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.	You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Berlin!	I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
I'll make it worth your while.	It's a rule.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?	I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.	Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.	Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
But you had so much *responsibility*.	I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Can't you tell me anything?	It's going to be a long spring.
Yeah.	What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Easterners.	We're just fine, thank you, sir.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.	Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We've got a lot of work to do.	Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
You know what I did.	Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.	But they'd still get the idea, right?
Are they?	Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.	Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?	Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.	What? On one hearing only?
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.	She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Does Cole know about this?	Really -- you went with him for two years.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?	You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
That's the way I see it, too.	Call me later.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.	Certain?
I'm sure.	I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
See! The big guy likes it.	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
So you're just going to be vindictive	In every sense. If at all possible.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.	Vodka tonic.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.	Yes, I *have*!
We can't lose.	How can you be so sure?
No.	You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
If you say so.	Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
I'm not really hungry.	C'mon. I insist.
He must be replaced.	And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?	Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
Why?	No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
What happened?	A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
We have to go.	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.	"""The fifth one this week""!"
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.	I'll do whatever I can to help.
True, but--	You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
You played for the Sox?	Double A. New Britain.
Alice...	Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
How will I get it to you?	If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes, Owen?	Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You didn't stop anywhere else?!	No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What's her name?	You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
That's great! Thanks.	'Sorry about the late notice...
Nice boat.	It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.	But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...	...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
Okay. I like that.	Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
That would be appropriate, yes.	How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?	Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?	You mean, did I want a date?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...	An eccentric recluse?
Uh... it's the end of October.	Is that soon?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.	DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.	What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.	"He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, ""Did you really do this just today?"" Cause I was impressed. He said ""What're you implying?"""
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.	Why?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.	Okay, Matt.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.	Don't stoop to his level!
I must find out what Berger knows.	Be careful.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.	Before they kill somebody else, too.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.	Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?	Yes, naturally.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.	No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!	What about one guy with two guns?
Yes.	So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Hiya, kid.	I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?	He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I just want to be alone.	"All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after ""Falcon Crest."""
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?	You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Me.	And who do I go to about you?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.	One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
So?	So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.	So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?	Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Frankly that's how I remember it.	But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Both would be nice.	Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Find them everywhere.	I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.	Your life, and that of others!
Tell me that's not the same guy.	Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.	How long can I afford to stay closed?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.	I forgive you.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?	Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?	Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.	Leeloo's in trouble?
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.	I love you.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...	Well, what should we do?
No.	You ever going to bed?
Halfdan the Black's here!	I know!
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?	God, yes. Like silk.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.	Who's now vanished.
Yeah.	Jeffrey? Why?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.	Alright.
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.	Where do we start?
Oh, Excellency, would you?	With all my heart, Mozart.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?	That's a canopy, John.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.	Talk English Doc.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.	I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.	No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.	I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
What's he talking about?	One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
We want to help...!	I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
"You tell them the ""Tale""."	What do you want? An apology?
Please.	Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I found it.	Did you see it?
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?	Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Simplicity, Hawk.	Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.	Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?	Lauren's not my wife.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.	Yes... I remember...
You... oh god, why?	I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Thanks for the advise, sir.	Keep me informed.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.	You wanna talk to her alone?
Put that phone down!	Get me the Radio Tower!
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.	I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.	Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Can I see it?	No.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.	It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.	Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?	Yeah.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.	Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.	Don't ruin this for me.
No.	Why not?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?	Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.	Guilt?
CONTINUED	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
What the --	What is it?
And the carrying charges?	Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?	Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.	A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.	Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.	Excuse me, my dear.
What are we going to do?	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Pupils?	Yes.
Why do they have to die for me?	They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
How are you doing, man?	Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?	Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.	I'm not bargaining!
Cornelius..	Oh god!
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.	Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.	Beg pardon?
Abbott?	He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.	So you never bought any land.
The wind blows... the fire burns...	I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Why... should YOU care?	Tell me your name?
How old do I look?	Twenty-five? Around there.
Where you gonna be?	Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Nice to meet you, Applejack.	You're Anthony?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.	Yes. Frank--
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.	What?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.	I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't understand.	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Maybe --	MAYBE WHAT --
Right here!	We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
What the fuck happened to you --	What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.	That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.	And the third one?
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.	Thank-Q!
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...	Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Don't you even think about it.	The place is falling apart.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.	How many men?
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.	Don't go playing policeman.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.	But if you'll just give me...
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.	Where'd she get you?
I'm feelin' dis'!	It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I just need to lie down for awhile	Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
What are you saying?	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
Your Majesty!	No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Call it what you want.	Everything you know is from me.
When's Brian coming for the TV?	Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.	This psycho can.
And a little ice.	And a little ice!
Say what, Manray?	Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?	What the fuck do you want from me?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.	My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
You are going to drive to the frontier.	It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.	You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
This is for me.	Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
It's a good job.	You mean the snake.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.	Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.	Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?	I think, before.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.	It's fine by me, Jesse.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.	I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.	A wife?
It says here, name Danger Powers.	Danger's my middle name.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.	How'd you get her out of town?
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.	I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.	Are you wasted?
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?	"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.	Don't make me do it, man
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.	For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...	Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
I'm going home.	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?	Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.	Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Is THAT Odin?	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
What'll you do?	I don't have the slightest idea...
Hi, Mona.	I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...	A snitch?
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.	I doubt it. She's just an...
"""The Strawberries""?"	The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
I think I just broke my hand.	Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.	Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.	I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?	Nothing. I was just asking.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.	He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Tavis, thank you for having me.	Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I think you should go now.	But I think...I want to know what happened here.
What is it?	Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
"Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  ""Boy?""  Did you say you were a ""country boy?"""	Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
What the hell are you talking about --	I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
What blood?	On your sleeve.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?	Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
What if I chant?	Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
She's my...cousin.	Uh huh?
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.	Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I never killed anyone.	"That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse."
I ain't mad at you...	I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
What?	That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.	It's a good one all right.
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...	Yes.  I remember her.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?
It can't do you any HARM...	What do we have to do?
Bent.	You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
What?	Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Hey man, we're all sorry...	She knew she was gonna die.
Listen, what's your name?	Al.
Jack, wait...	Just a second, that's all!
What was it we had for dinner tonight?	Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.	Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Hey...wake up.	Huh?
I don't even watch TV.	Good.  Good.  Commendable.
So you never bought any land.	Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Yes, father?! Yes?	...the pipe tobacco.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.	Hey, you know. I was thinking...
To kill me?	Nothing personal.
Where's Leeloo?	On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.	Yeah.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.	I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.	Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Do they have such thoughts?	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
What exactly is this place? Freezers?	Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Hello.	Hi.
What?	Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.	Because His Majesty wishes it.
What? I... I wasn't saying...	Please, there's no... Oh.
Crawl!	Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.	Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Don't talk nonsense.	He wants to kill US!
"""Frenzy""."	Yes I know.
Better?	Yeah.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!	LAZ, I said let...!
Beats forty hours on a plane.	They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
We never had a problem with that before.	Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?	I used it to start the fire --
Then don't talk about killing.	Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
They do to!	They do not!
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.	The great communicator.
The man. He's here.	What man?
When?	Tomorrow?
Where are you now?	I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
You're a good man, Hardy.	Really.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.	I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.	Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Is it drug related?	We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
No, he just hung out there.	And where did he go to school?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.	I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
I guess he got the message...	Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Fixing my roof.	It's not your roof anymore.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
... Hello... ?	Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?	I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
Yes.	Please join us.  Come on forward.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.	I don't have one.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.	Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Such a beautiful view.	Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.	Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.	It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.	But not completely inconceivable?
Let me get a shot of it.	Sit down!
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?	Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Yes!	I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
Sixteen dollars.	I know.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.	They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?	According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.	Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Do you know where they are?	Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...	The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
Yes.	Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.	Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Sorry about your window.	Can we go somewhere and talk?
Where's the wife?	You met her.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?	Just pure luck!
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.	That would explain the indigestion.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.	Okay...
Hello, there. What can I get you?	Campari and soda would do nicely.
Anything else?	There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
OK.	Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.	I'm not going to report it.
God, you're a slob.	But a fabulous cook.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.	Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...	It's not that.
Not a prayer.	Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
You're famous around here.	I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
You are throwing me out.	Get out.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Are you married?	No.  Are you proposing?
Please, have a seat.	Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Hawk?	Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
-- it hasn't been two years --	-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I'm sorry.	Please.
No, a cab will be faster.	I expect you shortly.
Your mom made that all by herself.	No kidding!
Alderman Swayzak.	Investigator Rimgale.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.	Why not?
Good.	And...
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...	Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.	Jesus Christ.
See, ya.	Why doesn't it never work out?
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.	I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?	Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  ""Jesse Woodson James."" Jesse James? The Jesse James?"	I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.	Italian?
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.	You believe that?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.	Please don't tell my daddy.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.	I'm afraid you have to eat something.
A real turd.	Well... hope she'll be very happy.
You're putting off the inevitable.	I'm putting it off.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.	No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?	What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.	Yes. What is it you want?
Daddy, I --	And where're you going?
You?  Personally?	I had it on the island with me.
It does?	Sure.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.	Ah... pity, pity...
Yes.	I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?	I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
I need another one, sir.	Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Shut up. Have you got your passport?	Yes.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.	Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?	Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
No, son. A pitcher.	Like one of Mom's?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.	God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.	C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.	Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.	No.  A deal's a deal.
Thank you for inviting.	I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Pris.	Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.	Oh no, my friend...
You gotta be kidding me. Her?	Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
What?	Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.	All right, Jack, all right.
How are you?	Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.	We're getting a little old for running.
We both lied to him.	What do you want me to say?
Yes John?	Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
You can always he thinner. Look...better.	Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.	And what can he do for you?
Really? What is it he's writing?	Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Everything okay?	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Where?	In your operation.
My father wouldn't approve of that that	You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
There's a lot you don't know about me.	You're right.
Thanks for the insight.	Brian, look --
Well, Sampson, what is it?	Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Oh.	But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
No. I just need some space, maybe.	The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
There aren't any coyotes in England.	The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Excuse me?	I said take off your fucking shirt.
Unwelcome.	Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?	No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?	The one with da big...
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.	Yeah.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.	Sure. Thanks.
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.	It must have been some other gate.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?	I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
That bitch from...	What?
Can you find her?	You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
They could clean around the arrangement.	I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.	This Rae... you get with her?
They're waitin' man.	I'll be there, goddamn it!
I'm not allowed to drive those.	Not even for emergencies?
Well, you can't always get what you want.	"""You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."
Ah! It's my father!	Open up! I know you're in there!
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.	Thank you.
I... accept your proposal!	I'm not just saying it!
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.	That's so typical, isn't it?
And just what is the game?	I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""	Yep.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?	Fine.
Well, I didn't want to assume.	Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Well?	If she is, the machine works.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.	That's preposterous --
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!	Look unimpressed.
Swear.	I swear --
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.	Peace is made is such ways.
That's why you're a gambling man.	That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
I'm just screwed.	You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
Say, you can't do that	I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!	Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.	I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.	No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
But a fabulous cook.	What are we having?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?	Great. Thank you.
Nine meters.  Eight.	Can't be.  That's inside the room!
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...	Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Know what a turtle is?	Of course.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.	I didn't mean to!
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Yes.	Did you see her undressed?
I know.	How do you know?
Not even that.	How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.	Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Jack is dead!	Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
No.	Have you had one?
My home.	There is one more thing, John. Here.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...	To you ... ?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?	Is that all?
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.	But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
What's that?	Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?	Please don't go there.
Mommy...?	Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Not right now.	Not right now?  Okay, when?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.	For your hands?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?	Wolfi!
My God, an actual operating 8-track.	What, you've never seen one before?
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--	She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.	As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Great car.	The best.
What happened?	Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Like what?	Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?	No.
And the bad news?	Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Danger's my middle name.	OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.	Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.	Which one?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.	We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.	What time is it?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!	Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.	All right. What are you gonna do?
We want to talk to you.	What about?
What do you think?	I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.	Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...	No, I mean... you love your son?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.	Don't you have a maid?
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?	YEAH!
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?	Yeah, I know.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes	You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?	You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.	I think she's great.
Ich said you left.	There was a change in plans.
They're on autopilot.	They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
What did you say?	Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.	Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.	The Greeks. The Italians.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.	Well, what'ya do?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.	Well, where are you --
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?	No.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...	... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
Go ahead, Jam.	We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.	And Laszlo?
How's that?	Oh, I could die...
Why? What for?	It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.	You're talking about complicity.
Stop.	You'll do it?
What of it?	Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Now wait...	With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.	Congratulations.
How. Did you. Know that?	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Not likely, convict.	You gonna let me keep any of it?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.	What are you saying, son?
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.	My dress'll reek.
Bob, you're lying!	Bullshit.
This is natural.	That's good. Keep it at forty.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.	Your mother was blind?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?	Yes, in the third act.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?	Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.	Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!	That would knock my father out.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.	Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
I understand.	Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.	Fuck you.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.	Everyone's working an angle, right?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?	The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.	Gee, thanks friend.
It's gonna get cold.	Right. Wait. A toast.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?	Yes?
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?	Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.	After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Know who I am, Jake?	The Anti-Christ?
Well, I could he wrong.	Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
I can get you a job.	A job?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...	How ya feeling?
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.	No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.	Yeah, well, you're late.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.	The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Why did you leave so soon?	That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Reach out and snort someone.	I'm saved. Let's party!
What are the Chevalier's intentions?	I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.	So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?	It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.	But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Oh, we're good man.	Yes, we are.
WELCOME?	Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.	Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
Everything seems to be in order.	Hey, wait a minute--
Have you got it straightened out now?	I think so.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.	I've already got more help than I need.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.	Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Yes I did...	Felt like a large asteroid.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.	He's a nigger.
To my health.	Kiss me.
I don't want to leave.	Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?	Not yet.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.	I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.	And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Is it that bad?	How do I look?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.	Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.	Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.	Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
How long will I stay here?	I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
What kind of mission?	We have to save the world.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.	All right, five hundred guineas.
You Hoto?	Fuck you. You a Hoto.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.	Surely there must be something you can do.
"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."	Who's to say you can't make things better?
You don't know Halfdan the Black.	I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.	Directors, eh? Long faces?
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--	Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?	Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
All right. What are you gonna do?	I want 15 on the Mets.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.	Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
"""Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James."" Only a dime in the hotel lobby."	Let me see that.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.	Look, I don't know what you want--
A common thief.	A patriot!
Don't worry, I won't report you!	I don't gamble.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.	Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
You don't have the demographics.	So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.	Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Promised? Who promised?	There, look!
More cough syrup?	Can I come in?
Victor Laszlo.	Victor Laszlo?
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?	That sounds great!
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.	Certified ladies' man, huh?
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.	We're quoting Mom again.
Did you do that when you were a kid?	Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?	There was something. It happened up your way.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.	Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
What?	Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
But what is it they don't like?	Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
No.	We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.	There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.	Why not go to work for me?
Yes. Frank--	Frank is coming?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.	I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Yes, naturally.	Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.	Let's take a look.
Oh, something. . romantic?	No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
No way to start a partnership.	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I can't let you do that either.	Because you're afraid!
When?	Tomorrow?
What the --	Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.	C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.	Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!
Do you want to stop?	Yes.
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
Nurse!	Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.	No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Hey! You don't know me --	I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.	Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
That's it, I'm goin'...	Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.	Why pick on him ?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?	Shut up!
I don't think your gun's loaded...	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You gotta let me finish --	Just come down, John. Just --
Isn't that -- extreme?	What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
This way.	Sun's gettin high.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.	How's that?
A sign from whom?	I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
Save it.	Sure, Hicks.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.	You sure?
You know them personally?	Yes.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.	He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Will.	Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.	...The rain falls...
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.	So there you are. What do you say?
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.	That's all right.
Yes, of course.	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?	New York.
Now!	Compute!
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?	I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?	No, you may not.
How much do you make now?	Four hundred a week, off the books.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.	Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.	Who are the other characters?
I had a spot of bother at the door.	I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Do you have a ticket?	You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I walk differently?	I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
So he fooled you.	If you say so.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.	"Uh huh. And ""Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins"". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?"
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?	They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?	Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Oh, would you...?	For you, I would do anything...
Acting the way we do.	Yes
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.
Yeah, Jimmy?	...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.	We can look out for ourselves.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Really?	I've never seen the ocean, either.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!	Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Where is your wife?	Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.	Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
They saved your ass, convict.	One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Rick!	Oh, no!
That's right.	Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?	You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Me? Four years.	If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
You calling Phil and Randy?	I'm calling Gary.
You didn't	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
They'd frame him.	He's out of prison?
We might need some mo' money behind this.	That can be done.
Don't be stupid.	All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
What if she never starts dating?	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Scraps.	Can I hold him?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.	When?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.	When I go?
Nice?	You like it there, don't you?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?	He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.	Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
You worm!	Once more!
I know all that.	What about a summary then.
Why would I tell Mom?	Because you tell Mom everything.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.	I'm happy I amuse you.
I found these. The others are still in storage.	Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
How much will you pay him?	Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Nice.	We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Where have I heard this song before?	You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Fancy a nibble?	I couldn't have another bite.
I want to die...  No, I don't!	Row! Row! Row!
"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"	No
And number three, Dolly.	Uh... two shooters!
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?	I could crush you like a roach.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.	Who?
You know.	Break stuff?
What do you want me to do?	Sit.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!	Sir, yes, sir!
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.	But this is different, sir. You're the President.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.	I plan to. Soon.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?	Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
You like Chicanos?	Sure.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.	I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --	I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?	Uh... not really.
But she does work here?	She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Good-bye, darling.	Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?	What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.	Some of the old songs, Sam.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.	Where did you go to school?
Bianca did what?	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Steed, we really must be --	Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
You cocky little bastard.	Ahh, you'll miss me.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.	You did Basic here?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.	I'll try and make it.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.	Really! Is it serious?
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?	Can't you tell me anything?
You better go.	Hell no.
I am so sorry, Jesse.	Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Is there anything else?	I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Yes, sir.	I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?	Witness?
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.	Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.	If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
You know, my son, our lord said...	Your lord.
Leeloo's in trouble?	When is she not in trouble?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
... bottle ...	Red ...
And it's too late to shut it down?	I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.	There's nothin' to talk about.
You know my name.	You know mine.
Right here in church?	Communion.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.	Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.	How do you know I will?
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.	Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --	Hardy, for Chrissakes --
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...	Who is Pamela Landy?
So how are you doing, dad?	Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?	No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
Richmond is not all the way down south.	I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
He's gone. He stole the car.	Where was it parked?
"Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?"	She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
...Why?	Remember Lyle Barton?
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!	Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Your dried cum.	Jesus.
The other ones?	The other one like you...
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again	I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?	Almost.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!	No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
...Something like that. Yeah.	Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.	So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?	Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.	A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
Yeah.	When?
Because it is my duty.	You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Something like that. You?	I lost a bet.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.	We have matching luggage.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.	Really?
About what?	This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Don't you have a maid?	Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
When?	Soon, baby.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.	What happened?
Feel like the dog's dinner.	Probably a touch of what's going around.
You've done pretty well.	Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
OK. That's wrong.	Dignan, it's --
Do you follow or should I speak slower?	Yes.
They really made her...	Perfect.
That is correct.	And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!	So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.	Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
And something to sharpen them with?	Yes, Mum.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...	Don't give me this, we were partners.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --	-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
How can that be?	They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Father, I'll do you right here.	God have mercy on my soul.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?	Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.	So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.	We must sue for peace.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.	Jesus, Teddy.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.	Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
But there's another side--	Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.	How many days until you come home?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.	Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.	But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
I get it.	Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
You stole a Trans-Am.	Yes. I did.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?	Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.	A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.	Oh really? I didn't know that.
Oh yes?	And what was that, John?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?	As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?	Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.	Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
I can't remember.	Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Half watch dog?	Yeh, he's only got one eye.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...	You're really pissing me off.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.	You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.	Ask me a question.
Go to the bathroom.	Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.	And you gonna live it with him?
Huh?	Therefore, I shall ignore you.
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.	That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!	You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Thanks..	You're welcome..
I should maybe talk to you.	Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Pick you up Friday, then	Oh, right.  Friday.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...	You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.	Don't even start.
Excuse me, Skipper---	Yes, Griff?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?	Nope.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.	See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.	With every breath we shall hunt them down.
But how come I'd be there?	Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.	Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Wait a second --	Now!
You're also a fool.	I think you should go now.
Start a band?	My father wouldn't approve of that that
Notice something funny about that bus?	Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.	You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?	We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...	No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?	'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.	First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Are you reasonably awake?	Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Let go...	My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.	The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Nothing on Hannah?	A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
Dad!	I hate you! I hate you!
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.	Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.	How?
Yeah?	Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.	Money?
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.	Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --	That's exactly what he says about you.
What about one guy with two guns?	Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Lenny? Come on!	Oh my God oh my God...
Just thought I'd...	No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.	I didn't mean to scare you like that.
I like it fine here.	He'll double what I pay you.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.	Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.	Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.	Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.	That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...	I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Doctor Peel, I presume?	And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
How do you do?	One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.	You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Why do you wish to sail west?	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.	Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?	Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.	DUDES!
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?	You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?	Why?
"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."	You think I don't know that?
Are we going to sleep now?	That's right.
Pinback...	Yes, Doolittle.
Like a painting?	No, son. A pitcher.
Al.	Speak up. Come on.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.	You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...	Oh no?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.	How much do you know?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?	Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.	One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
She's in the bathroom.	Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?	We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.	Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
That's right.	Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Yeah.  Sometimes.	I wish I could.
You've done it again?	Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
What happened?	Eee Oott Auught!
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?	Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.	Look, bomb...
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?	He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?	I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Who else can give me information about you?	Only the agency of servants.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.	Me neither.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.	Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?	There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.	Isn't that -- extreme?
Yes?	Can I come in?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!	Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
No.	If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?	I plan to grow on you.
Here's to you, sir.	Er, good luck, yes.
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.	See you later.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.	If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?	Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I want women.	That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.	But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?	It was in Latin, sir.
I wasn't saying anything.	Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
I got...	Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Are you getting tired?	Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.	Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?	Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Daddy...	Alice... I...
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.	You got that?
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.	Let me guess, Russia came up?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.	Then why did you quit?
"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."	Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.	No!
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...	It was Peter -- I saw him ...
No!	I'll bring it back.
Why so?	Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?	We won, Austin.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.	You've killed your fair share of men.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?	Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.	...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong	The king can do no wrong!
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.	I am trying.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.	I believe these young men are right.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?	Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Frank is going to kill.	Who is he going to kill?
On account of we're robbing it.	Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Can... can... Can I have this?	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.	He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
Home sweet home!	To you maybe.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.	Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
But not his body.	What difference does that make?
How do you know?	Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?	Bought himself a pocketbook!
As much as possible?	Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Oh.	Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.	Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.	Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Oh, now, that's a great one!	You like it?
Okay, I guess.	Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
Okay, but it has to be a small one.	Everything is going to be just fine.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.	When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?	He'll tell me when he gets home.
Cross my heart.	And hope to die?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.	No wonder you're so popular.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?	Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Akina delutan, nou-shan.	...'Scuse me?
Where is she?	Takin' a bath.
Exactly.	Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.	Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?	I'm serious.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.	Jesus, Patrick!
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.	And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Yes sir.  What's that?	A dressing bag.
That's preposterous --	Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?	Yes...
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.	Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.	It would kill you, huh?
What do you want?	I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
But you weren't. I could tell.	I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
Uh, Matthew...	Back off, George.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?	I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?	To explode, of course.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?	Sometimes.
Why pick on him ?	It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.	Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
He's not here.  Why ask me?	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.	All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
You get the eye?	I brought it.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...	"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."
What??	That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What's that?	A brothel.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.	We know.
Erik! Row! What are you doing?	It saved my father!
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --	I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Forget it.	I'm sorry.
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...	Here's hoping, baby...
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?	Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
You burn, you pine, you perish?	Who is she?
So?	When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.	Got it.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.	Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.	Why's that?
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --	The Army can hang him.
Of course.	Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Did he give any reason?	He suggested I ask you.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?	We're on.
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.	Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.	Don't exist bud.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.	You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
What's the plan.	First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
I need to know who you are first please.	Oh.  We are Russian.
Oh, you think I'm lying?	Yes.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?	Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.	Stand by. Bird Dog?
Yeah?	Paulie, you've got kids, right?
Why are you shaking?	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Yes.	I guess you've seen some bad things.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.	Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.	Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Well . . .	Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.	Who is she?
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.	"We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"""
The what man?	The fat man.
They just want you to hire some new help.	"Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any ""new help."""
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.	It's dark.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?	Loretta, shut it.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.	Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
The Institute ... the funding ...	A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
And I was wondering.	Yes?
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.	Yes, dear!
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.	Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
What?	In 9th.  For a month
He's your boss. He's not your --	I know, I know.
The nocturnal flying mammal?	No. Sit down.
Then who wrote the report?	It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.	Tommy, take a walk.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!	-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.
I don't think so.	You do it then.
Yeah, I know.	Then start taking them seriously.
We'll come up with the next big thing.	...You wanna work -- here?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?
There was a coffin?	Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?	Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.	And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.	Occupied France?
That I did it again.	You've done it again?
Well, don't do that again!	How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.
Who do you ask?	You seem...nervous.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.	No.
Alone.	What for?
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.	I don't know anything about it.
What kind of a dog is he?	He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
You could put it that way.	But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.	You're paranoid, Bob.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.	We're running out of time, sir.
What...?  What if I say no?	Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.	I don't want to hear that word!
And your charming little daughter?	Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Love, Sire!	Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!	Have him committed.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.	I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?	Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
I'm not telling you what happened.	Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Applejack drove.	Run. Run. Let's go.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!	Newt, wait!
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?	Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.	Forget it.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?	Maybe so.
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.	What mission?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.	Days??
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'	Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
That's Sherry VanHafton.	I've been in love with her since the second grade.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.	I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Get back?  From where?	Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Then what else can we do?	Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.	No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
I was at Harrow ...	But did they teach you this?
Wait. That's not what I've got.	What?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?	The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
What about Oleg?	Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Got it.	Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.	You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!	It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Really?	Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.	You're just going to have to trust me.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.	And it's called...?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.	A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?	Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?	Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.	In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Why?	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I said... STOP!	I CAN'T!
Did you hear what I said?	I want to document my trip to America.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?	We... met them last night.
Maybe.  Maybe not.	Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Why? What's in Lisbon?	The clipper to America.
You've said that already.	I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?	Yes.
Sure, I do	Why?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.	They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Do they know yet?	Know what?
You're not.	I need you on my side.
What's the Blue Book price?	That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.	Sixty days?
I don't think we can do that.	I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
CONTINUED	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm listening.	It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
What are what?	Those things in your hands.
I asked you about school.	I think about... fucking a lot during school.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!	Sorry.
But I have no excuse to close it.	Find one.
I'd take him to the doctor.	You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Hawk.	Pick a song, Hawk.
Meet me at my place later.	How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.	A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.	Might be different in New York.
Can anyone else see him?	I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Are you feeling okay?	Uh-uh.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.	Well, thank you, Mary.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.	These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
It's gotta be right for my customer.	Your customer, eh?
No, Brett, I...	It's all right...  So have I.
Bloom like a flower?	Yes.
I am, Your Eminence	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!	Stop what?
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.	Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.	All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
"""Here,"" wh-wh-what?"	My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
What?	Goodnight!
Like he would find Dignan. One day.	Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Definitely!	I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
You're foreigners.	Work with me.  I want your best detective.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.	You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I was all of these.	Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -	And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.	One more reason to shoot first eh?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.	Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?	I really don't know.
Is Sandy part of this?	No, not at all.
I know.	I haven't given you much of a life.
What is it?	I don't know.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?	Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Keeping the Fix happy.	You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Yeah.	Did you know him?
And that fits?	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.	What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Five this week; how many the week before?	You're as bad as my father.
No. It is too judgmental.	Tell me what he said.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?	No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
You were right. She's still pissed.	Sweet love, renew thy force!
"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"	Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
What else do you need?	I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?	Of course.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?	It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?	We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .	Well, you can. You always could.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.	Shit.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!	Twenty-four hours, detective.
How old are you?	That's not really a very proper question.
For your own sake... For the others... I...	Hang on...
You folks need any help?	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?	Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.	Yeah, right.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.	Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
He says. This is he.	This is he?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.	No. It's because you don't know how they died.
Do you believe I love you?	I... but I...
Why not?	That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Alright. How much you need, ho?	The hell you call me?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?	No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Boo.	Hi.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?	Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Do...what.	Get married. Have a wedding.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.	What...?  Do I have so many already?
So what are you doing here?	He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.	All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
We'll make them pay for this.	I'm out.
Then why?	Because he is not afraid of me.
I'm hungry, J.F.	I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
You enjoy it?	Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
But did you know him?	Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
What?	We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
Sleep. Sleep now.	I should be better by now.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.	When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.	Hmm-mmmm.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?	Yeah, very big, a giant.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.	Who -- who are you?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --	I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Who to?	The President of the United States.
Pop?	Grandpa. My father. It's his.
We can do that.	Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
On a ride.	A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.	That'd change with a criminal indictment.
We'd better get back now.	Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.	I need to do it.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..	What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?	Yes.
Do you have bad dreams, too?	Some, everyone does.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...	The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
I'm a werewolf.	A werewolf?
I shall need a small plane.	You're not venturing alone, surely.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?	It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Why the hell not?	I don't, that's all.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?	I think it's marvelous. Truly.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.	Is that why you're still here?
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --	"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""
Wait --	What.
Why do they do that?	Do what?
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.	Yes, sir.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.	Yes mother.
Yes?	If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?	Sunday, but...
How long they been livin' here?	You hear that question, Garcia?
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.	I know.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.	And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I can't wait.	Well, promise then.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!	Get a hold of yourself, man.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.	I get it. You can drop it now.
Say thank you.	Thank you.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.	You know my father?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.	We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
I thought I was the bad guy!	You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
So, um --	Would you get me another, Joely?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'	Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Huh? Wha...	I can't sleep.
Think we'll get him, Nick?	We can't lose.
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?	Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.	That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Are you trying to read my palm?	You've got such beautiful hands.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!	Are you crazy?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.	You ain't happy about the green light?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.	Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
I will.	You know where the chemicals are?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.	Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
And the Landy woman?	She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
You think?	Oh yeah.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.	You need to go.
Actually. I've been in twice.	Twice. Without her sensing anything?
So uh...	Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
I'm going back.	Not in that car you're not.
Get me ten bags of mulch.	Yes'sir.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.	It says here, name Danger Powers.
Good. Who?	Mel Gordon.
You and Verona?	What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Nothing.	You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
What did you see? What did it look like?	Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Here you are.	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?	Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...	I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.	We know all that, Exposition.
Grandma Death.	That is a terrible nickname.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!	Neat. Goodnight!
Do you like it, being pregnant?	I do.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.	Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.	Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Why on earth do you say that?	I looked.
Look at you... You want to go.	For what? A couple hundred bucks?
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.	I think someone hasn't.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.	Well...yeah. Okay.
Three years, two months. March '93.	What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.	I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Well, maybe he did, huh?	His girlfriend doesn't think so.
...He knows.	What?
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.	Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Home, I'm done.	What about the confession?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?	No thanks.
Yes he did.	Where is he?
Want a bite?	I'm on a diet. But thank you.
I had it on the island with me.	Must be a story there.
Joyce can be nice.	What'd she say?
Where?	In a harem.
I'm a working stiff, pops.	Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!	...I can't wait to be among you.
Is it about my teeth?	Yes.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.	You should stay.
It's very late.	Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
How you let men treat ya like they do?	What?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.	Look.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.	Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
You have tranquilizers?	I told you! I've got everything!
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
Everybody's divorced.	It didn't used to be that way.
The one with da big...	Not her, the one with the little...
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.	Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
Sir, yes, sir!	The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!	I hope you get your work done.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.	How potent?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.	Are you ill?
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.	Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?	I'm getting a ride.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...	You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Watch the news?	Nah, I musta missed it.
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
I don't think this is a good time...	...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
He said he worked there --	No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.	What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.	You're joking.
But --	Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.	I guess not.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?	"I think we've all seen ""Bonanza""."
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.	Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?	Cole, he didn't mean that.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
I can handle that.	Well, get to it.
Your life, and that of others!	If they agree to follow me, yes.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.	And Outpost? You're happy there?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.	You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Thirsty.	Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.	I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Not in the mood, I guess.	But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
How do you know I will?	Intuition.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.	I understand.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?	Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
No thanks. I don't drink.	Yeah. I forgot.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.	I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
You and Mel Gordon?	Could be.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.	And the other alternative?
I have no luggage.	The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!	Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?	I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.	And what else?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..	BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.	Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
You almost got us killed!	I told you I've never driven before!
Yeah, old times.	We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.	How so?
Kat a fan, too?	Yeah...
What's the pay?	What's fair?
Do you like it?	Yeah.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.	Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.	We're not.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.	I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Colon!	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.	Corporal Hicks!?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?	I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?	Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
And how do you feel about that?	I don't wanna take over the family business.
Is David acting strangely?	No, not really.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.	Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
The very same.	You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.	This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?	Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Every little boy's fantasy.	Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.	I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.	We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We stay down here.	We do?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?	What am I gonna do?
If I'd known you were alive --	I would have done the same thing.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.	Hey! You don't know me --
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.	Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Really?	Don't talk about it much, though.
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!	I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.	Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Dave - !	What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--	But why can't we stay here?
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.	Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.	Fortunately, they did.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...	Then what's stopping you?
I've always thought that myself.	Oh, yes.
I knew you would.	New worlds create new people.
Leave it.	No. Answer it!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.	You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?	For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Come on, Dignan.	"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."
What do you believe in then?	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.	Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
We... met them last night.	They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.	Okay, but it has to be a small one.
One who's not a mutant.	No dogs, huh? Okay.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?	If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?	That's where we came out.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?	A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?	No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
I'm dreaming.	Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?	Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
You don't believe me?	About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Feel free.	First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!	Yes, boss.
For magazines?	I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --	You're the only one missing a grenade.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?	Yes!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.	Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Everyone's working an angle, right?	There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
How are you?  Having any luck?	I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
You will wait?	What d'you expect me to do?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.	They must have turned him down.
Yes.	Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Yes.	A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Keep trying.	I'm on it.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.	Well, that's blunt!
I'll say it.	OK. Go ahead.
How much?	$383.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --	Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.	He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.	I'll keep it in mind.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.	Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?	You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
How long... how long I been out?	You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Will I see you tonight?	I never make plans that far ahead.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?	I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.	English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.	Roger.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--	Yes on all counts.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.	I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Then Elaine was right.	Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
What do you think was wrong?	I have no idea.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...	One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.	What if it's not who you think it is?
You've got a call.	I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!	Six days ago, yes.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.	No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?	Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.	She was unconscious, Patrick.
So they can be on TV.	You sound like the media.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.	It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?	Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.	Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Yes.	Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.	Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Everything is quite all right.	Oh, Rick!
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.	You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.	Was it a teddy?
Bruised.	Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
Black...	... death ...
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.	You just feel sorry for me.
Now, how are you going to do that?	Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Erik. You don't understand.	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?	You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
So why didn't you kill me then?	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.	I stick my neck out for nobody.
"You're so spoiled. What is ""not good"" to you? Only a few hundred --"	We've got sixteen dollars.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.	Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Just for him?	Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.	Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.	Yeah.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --	Now, wait a second --
I'm playing to win.	Winning isn't everything.
They had to be dealt with!	By burning down their homes?
Jeffrey! Come on in.	Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
What kind of trouble?	I owe a lot of money.
No way. You have this -- destiny.	C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Who, Dorothy?	Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Oh nothing.	Tell me.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...	I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?	We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
What for?	Because I want to get married.
That's crazy.	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
Why there is no other man in my life?	Uh huh.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.	Hey.  I'm a professional.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.	What'chu sayin'?
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!	I know...and I'm really sorry.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!	No... he's not... not... there...
Hey, no kidding?  In color?	Cross my heart and hope to die.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.	Does this person have a name?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?	Look, you cocksucker...
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.	Talby, can you read me?
Coffee's perked.	When did she die?
That's OK.	Look. We want you on the job.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?	Yes.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?	That I cannot tell you.
You're off to a late start.	So noted.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?	Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
You think that's really any of your business?	Well, you did invite me here.
I was reading too.	What's the story?
See if mine are in there.	Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Oh no?	Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Well, I am the head of this household--	I want him to at least see the sky!
Why?	Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Everything you know is from me.	Yeah.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?	Who told you this, Majesty?
You said speak Czech!	How you erase this?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?	It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.	I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...	You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.	It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
It's just my heart.	What you got a picture of your heart for?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.	Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
Mm-hmm.	Such as?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?	Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Hey? You like to walk.	What?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.	Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
"What Kendall said -- ""the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around."" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter."	Are you sure?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Monsieur Rick?	Yes?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.	The Clock People?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.	Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Why don't they come to me?	This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
What you sayin' boy?	I think I recognize you.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.	Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Kiss me.	Behave!
How about some ammo?	It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.	And that's how you got me in the first place.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.	I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Up where?	Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?	No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?	Who have you been talking to?
Uh..	You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
For a change.	How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!	How 'bout we check with Eve first?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?	I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
People, too.	Then who wins?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.	So...the station is empty?
What do you mean?	All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?	Max--
Do you get to meet Ed?	If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.	Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Huckleberry Hound?	I don't know what that means.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.	Nobody's that unhappy.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.	I know.
What was that?	Clockworks.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...	The army kicked you out for drugs...
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.	Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.	Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Where --	Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
So -- how far are we from the campus?	Oh we're not going to the campus.
What are these for?	Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.	Yes, I'll bet.
How much?	How much do you make now?
Forgive me father.	Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.	His office. You mean my old office.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...	I'm sorry.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!	You're right, sir.
Because His Majesty wishes it.	Is the Emperor angry with me?
What did he say? What did he say?	Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
I'm doing okay.	From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?	He and the NRA don't like the wording.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!	But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.	You said --
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?	Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?	"The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: ""A country boy can survive!"""
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.	I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Some party.	Maybe we should do something?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.	So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
You bring the cigarettes?	Oh, sure.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.	Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --	You and the Colonel go back.
No. Frank.	Who's Frank?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.	No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.	You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?
We should tell him we're not going.	"Oh, yeah, ""Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on."" He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland."
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.	I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!	Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?	It was bad.
...Worse?	"Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  ""Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world."" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one."
What's keeping you?	Oh, Charlie again.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--	It was open.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.	We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.	Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Have you done this sort of thing before?	Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Yes, sir.	And tell him not to delay.
Sorry.	Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.	...But?
Bruno's girlfriend.	Oh, yeah?
They aren't answering their hails.	This doesn't make sense.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!	Papa!
Pamela Landy?	I don't know who that is.
Hey.	You ain't the kicker, are you?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.	Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Seconds and thirds, too.	Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
The Old Lady by the swamp.	She was a witch.
This must be the last straw.	Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!	Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
We'll keep going, Roc.	You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
He killed a police officer.	Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.	If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.	How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
CONTINUED	I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.	You noticed..
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!	Well, I am the head of this household--
But you were punished.	Yes. I went to jail.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?	Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
"-- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""	How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.	I'm afraid he's been stalling.
What's a synonym for throbbing?	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
No.  that was the last one.	Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
What time is it?	It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?	It won't.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.	You expect me to believe that?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself	Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I know who it is.	Good. Who?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'	'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
What do you think I do?	A model? An actor?
How did you guess?	Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
But Dad --	Now.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?	Isn't it incredibly obvious?
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.	What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?	And you are...?
-- Remark.	5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.	Oh yes, yes. And that was?
I'm sorry.	How long? How long do I have --
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.	How will I get it to you?
Short shift?	Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Hello?	Hey, Murph.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.	Something bugging you?
You have excellent English.	Thanks.
Gaiijin.	I'll check it out.
You're sure? It's cold.	I don't want to take you out of your way.
I could hang myself.	If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?	Jack?  What was that?
You might not kill it.	You think so.
No!  We must do this alone.	Do what?!  George-- ?!
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...	...We're coming in.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...	The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.	I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?	No.
You're kidding.	Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.	Well, maybe he did, huh?
How long can I afford to stay closed?	Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.	And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Neil... Neil Cole.	Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?	I'm a Catholic.
Could it be intelligent?	Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
Commander? Are you still there?	Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
You don't get it, he's after me...	Don't worry, honey
You're joking.	To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.	Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.	Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.	A Fed? Is he close?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.	And that is?
You really think he wanted to kill you?	All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
The door, Jack.	Leave it.
How did you get this gig?	Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
I know. I know.	Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Where?	I don't know. He's not on the map.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.	He has?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.	There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
Can I kiss you too?	Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.	I know.  Uh...Alice.
Sir?	Yes, Hicks?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.	I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Let's eat our cake.	Yeah. Let's dig in!
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?	No -- impressed.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --	You made me look like an idiot --
You go fast!	Do you have it?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.	Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.	What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Had you talked to him much lately?	Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?	My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.	Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Is he your boyfriend?	Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.	Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Oh, leave me alone.	One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.	What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.	How be dat?
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...	Guess you're right.
This morning.	Where was I?
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.	How lovely.
I'm on at nine.	Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.	Bob's upset.
...like grits and butter...	...like fried and chicken...
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.	Especially tonight.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.	No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.	Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
He's on to us!	Shit! What are we gonna do?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?	I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Conklin.	He's dead.
What about Luther?	What about Ganz?
That's not gonna fly.	With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.	You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Come with me.	Where we going?
And what else?	I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
I got a lot to protect.	Bullshit.
Money.	Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.	He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.	Promise?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.	Your mom was a dancer?
Because I want you to tell me.	The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.	Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?	Oddly enough, I do.
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?	On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Watching television in color.	Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Oh, thank God. It's going.	It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.	This is not my usual Friday night!
But it IS! Look!	The important thing is not to panic.
Oh yeah.	Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Where?	Anywhere.
Jesus, why?	I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.	How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?	Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
As much as possible.	As much as possible?
Please. Why not?	Because it was a lie.
She was European!	All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
I would advise you not to interfere.	I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.	Hey, you know what I really think?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...	Over the Edge of the World.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?	Absolutely.
What do you mean, West's?	I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
What?	You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!	You know - it <u>is</u>?
It was amazing.	Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
You can start Monday week.	Fine.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?	You've never been?
This, this... This is bullshit!	Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.	I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...	He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.	Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
May I speak freely?	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
Why not?	It's killing me.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.	"Adam,  I think for you, we should go for ""sweet."""
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
A-flat, Majesty.	Ah-ha!
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?	Fine.  We gotta him.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.	Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Yes?	Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
I hope it brings you luck.	It will.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.	As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.	No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.	Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Yes?	I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
You been home yet?	Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
How well are you trained in music?	I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
How is Central these days?	Terrible boring.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.	Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.	You've got a point there.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.	Really.
Last night.	You have a good time?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.	You're not.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.	Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You're my conscience.	Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.	Whoever that is.
No. Just pool.	You Hoto?
Before they kill somebody else, too.	Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?	You saved my life in alot of ways.
What time did Matt Brown get in?	Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.	Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Cool.	What are you doing?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.	Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Yes. Here's your ticket.	You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.	She's a big girl.  She understands.
Why? What's wrong?	My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Hello, Helen!	Matt, come here!
What do we do?	Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Is that who you're waiting for?	No...
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.	Ah-ha.
Okay, be careful.	Okay, Sandy.
Well.	I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.	You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Oh, yeah?	Yeah.
Yes. He likes windows.	Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?	Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Uh huh?	She's from...France.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.	Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Good morning, Cheeba.	Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Huh?	I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
My brother's in jail.	What are you talking about?
None too discreet, is he?	No, sir, he is not.
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --	Shut up!
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?	Yes! I've only seen one, though.
-- Is what?	Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Do you think that's funny?	Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.	How did you end up here?
You're serious, aren't you?	What's that supposed to mean?
What's that? What's it called?	One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?	That's enough.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.	Well, this is just fucking great...
"He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said ""The answer's not in the box, it's in the band."" Know what it means?"	It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Not at all.	Where's our friend?
What?	What desert?
I don't want you to wait for me.	That's something you can't decide.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.	No I haven't.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.	It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!	We started over, you can too.
No, I'm not. I need a job.	The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Let's get him over to the bed.	Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
I could easily arrange...	No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Never before this.	How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.	Meaning?
I think...it...works.	Let me show you the entire trousseau!
See you tomorrow, maybe.	You okay?
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.	Let's lift up her shirt.
I don't want to move away.	I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.	What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
Are you hit?	No.  I'm okay.
I don't think that has anything to do with --	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Where the hell you been?	You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?	In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.	Did you talk to him?
Money and nothing else?	Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Is Miss Dugan well?	There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.	You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...	A job for me?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.	You wanted to get the truth.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?	I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.	Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
"This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it."	Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.	Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Yeah. It's stupid.	I guess they're stupid.
Shut up and go home, will you?	No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?	I didn't say shit.
The fuck you been doin' to me?	I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?	Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.	Don't you want answers?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?	Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?	Nuthin' I can't handle.
"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."	That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
It couldn't have been earlier?	No. It wasn't earlier because...
How can you be so certain?	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.	Who else can I ask around here?
What time did this thing happen?	The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
You wanna talk to her alone?	Yeah.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.	The gear is down.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?	Would you have believed me?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.	Yeah, probably a good idea.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.	I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
And you are...?	Evan Treborn.
Who's doing this?	Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?	I don't know!
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?	No.
Uh, George...	Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.	What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...	Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
I'm not. But there's --	You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Uh... dudes?	Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.	Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.	How soon?...
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?	I don't call him, I whistle.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.	Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
Mio caro Adone.	Ah!
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!	They just want you to hire some new help.
Alice...	Since when are you such a smart shopper?
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?	Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Like how?	I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.	"You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his ""fall"". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.	I'll do it.
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.	I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Harcourt is dead.	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.	Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?	When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Your clothing reeks of it.	"You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even ""hello,"" you accuse me... ?"
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?	Dr. Homer Wells.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.	Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?	"Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, ""it's all about the Benjamins."""
Yeah...	That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
So, I met a new friend.	Would you like to talk about this friend?
You ever going to bed?	No.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --	You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'	Bad last moment - I cut it out.
And you want to know --	-- Will he keep his word?
Not her, the one with the little...	Oh her.
I don't have the slightest idea...	I'll see ya around, huh?
I don't know.	Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?	Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
You've acquired a taste for this?	It's quite nutritious, sir.
Liberator...	Have you enlisted?
Have you taken my message to him?	The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
How so?	By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?	One thing I've learned as
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?	Sounds like a game show host to me.
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --	Ichiro --
You know, Nick, we can't lose.	Why's that?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.	We're all like that.
How much do you know?	I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.	I got others.
Huh?	I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Joey never told you we went out, did he?	What?
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...	No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.	You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.	Something about a plane with no pilot?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?	Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?	I want Debbie.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.	Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Pay money?	Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.	"""The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places."" Ernest Hemingway."
How do you know that?	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
First time I ever heard that.	I was expecting someone else.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.	How'd you find me here?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.	Do you have the suspect in custody?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.	You couldn't get to him?
I am not.	Oh, yes you are.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...	Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!	It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.	Only holds five.
That's a heavy sedation.	You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
...Priest...	You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Too many cooks --	Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
He's terribly busy, sir.	I understand.
I'm so hungry.	Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?	I've never LOVED anybody!
May I help you?	Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?	Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.	David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
How come you're not on the job?	I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
I fell out of my bed last night.	You slept too near where you got in?
There's nothing wrong with me!	Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.	Machine's in?
Flower ...	... power ...
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.	Who's Mr. Henry?
I couldn't lose him.	Jim Younger, I told you--
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?	Yeah, I do, but go to work.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?	Too early to tell.
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.	Could it be intelligent?
It's true, Dignan.	Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
You did this for me?	Yes.
He electrocuted someone?	It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!	You tell that to them!
Well you did.	Give me some?
Who are you?	I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.	What view?
They're making him a hero now.	Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.	I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
We did not leave together.	Who did he leave with?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?	Two more.
No.	You might wanna think about it
We'll find out soon enough.	Me neither.
How much money are you carrying with you?	I have five-hundred dollars.
Yes.	Then what the fuck?
That's...that's too bad.	You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Something wrong?	Being back here. Gives me the willies.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.	Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
I wanted to see you.	Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
You equipped for random questions?	Why, yes, of course.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --	What do you mean, alone?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --	Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.	This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.	Your honor must lower his voice.
What about the trees?	The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Actually only one cell survived..	Have you identified it?
You mean that play?	Exactly.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.	You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?	Eleven fifteen.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?	Oh Frederick.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.	She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...	Oh.
What about what?	What about the money?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.	Dunbar.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.	I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.	Good.
And what do you do, Lucy?	I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.	Why?  What's wrong with me?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.	You'd be surprised how often they are.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.	I don't think so.
What?	Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.	Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
How do I look?	Like shit.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.	I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
But, I don't understand.	And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
What good stuff?	"The ""real you""."
"Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? ""You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it""."	Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Jesus Christ.	Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?	The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Shh.	No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.	No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
God... That's in a week!	That's what it says.
No... he's not... not... there...	Tell him I'm coming!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!	Shut up!
He's odd.	He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
Fine, you do it.	Fine, I'm doing it.
Putty? On both doors?	There's something else kinda interesting...
You must have been crazy.	Guess what I'm wearing.
Some tap dancing, some singing.	Where do I sign?
I want to yank Kobo.	Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?
Sort of like a letter of intent.	Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?	What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Am I?	Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
I'll have to enclose the check first.	You do and I'll fire you.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.	Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Be careful.	Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
"He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to ""help""! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!"	It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.	Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
We don't split up!	They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.	We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?	Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Everything in order?	All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
No, I'm not playing this game.	No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.	Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.	So what's up with you and DeLa?
A couple of peons for the mob and...	Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.	No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.	We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --	All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.	I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I didn't mean to hurt you.	Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.	Great, Mom.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...	No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
You must be mad...!	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?	I beg your pardon?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?	In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!	The case was stolen?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.	Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
You wanna go home?	It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
You're paranoid, Bob.	Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.	Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
What?	The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
We can't stop!	They've tricked us.
What?	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?	Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.	You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Who's in the car?	That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!	Dignan! Stop!
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...	Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.	You're saying I have no choice.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?	It was a good ad-lib, sir.
I might have mentioned it.	John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?	Edward Bloom.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.	That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Answer the phone.	No.  Tell me what you want to say.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.	Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.	Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
We should talk.	We've done all our talking, Wade.
Who is he?	New York's finest.  This is his case.
Shoot.	Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
But you found another choice.	I did.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?	You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
How did you get so many?	I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
What're you looking for?	A grand.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --	-- where's left to go? --
You don't care if I die	Sure, I do
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...	I don't need your gratitude.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.	Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...	Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Guess so.	So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Do me an enormous favor?	Anything.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.	Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Has it got a wow finish?	I don't know the finish yet.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.	And?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.	Okay Frank.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.	Be careful.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.	We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
But you didn't.	No. Poetic justice, though.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?	But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer	Cyril!
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.	Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.	I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Why did you?	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
No idea who. No idea why ...	Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.	I just did.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.	Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
So far?	Yes, I'm right?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?	'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?	Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Did you shoot the rapids?	No, but I shot some ducks.
Why were you so careless?	I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
You think that's the place she's buried?	If they actually bothered to bury her.
How did you know that?	I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Are you all right, honey?	I was gonna bring it back myself.
Is your Evian spiked?	We should do it.
Jack doesn't need money.	Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?	Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I believe these young men are right.	You know them personally?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.	Okay.
Is he working?	I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Good.	What is your name?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.	Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?	This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
I should have got rid of you long ago!	Like you got rid of Snorri!
Oh, come on, tell us.	No. You've had your chance.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.	So what?
You sing and dance?	A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I know!	He wants to KILL us.
I tried that already.	Did you try going through C-Gate?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.	Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
Yes.	Excuse me.
YEAH!	Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Fine.	Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?	Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.	Wouldn't dream of it.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.	Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Where'd she get you?	She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.	I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .	Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
So, I've got to drop the van off.	Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.	No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
I don't know nothing about it.	You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?	Got it.
So? Be real easy.	Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
So?	Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?	You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.	Thank you.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!	The zoo?
Yeah, if you've slept.	You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Give men that. I know how to do it.	Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?	Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.	William would never have gone to a state school.
Right on the button.	Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
"""I saw you waiting there, by the gate."""	I...
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.	Screw you!
Yeah.	Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Gretchen. We're going together now.	Do you think a lot about girls?
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.	Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
What are you talking about?	I'm not worth risking your life for.
Leave that alone!	Wolfi!
If I...you know...	What? Whatever you want, Helen!
We had an argument. He's being silly.	I swear, I don't know this girl.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?	I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.	Really? Is he cute?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.	This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?	I have a good crew.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.	Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.	The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
You are Cassandra?	That's right.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.	Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?	Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Is it yes?	Yes.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.	Yes what?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.	Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Are you ready Ilsa?	Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Yes.	All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.	Thank you, Mr. President.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.	But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
So what's up with you?	What do you want to know?
So did your father...	So did my father and his father before him.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.	That was two hours ago.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.	Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.	Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
And I just liked you so much.	You did? You liked me?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.	After torpedo room:  Report!
You know it's a trap.	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.	I know that.
Safety on?	Yeah.
You'll know soon enough.	Where did you come from?
Of course not. I was married to your father.	Did you ever want to?
You've had today's water.	Thirsty.
You'll be sucked down too!	No! Arrgh!
When are you coming home?	In three days, darling, I hope.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--	Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
Wolfi.	Yes, my love?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.	It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.	Yes, sir.
Jack?	The other guy.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Not in that car you're not.	Watch me.
What else is new? Right?	Yeah. What are you doing now?
"Now we're on the right track... Put back ""dear""... How does it read?"	"""My dear""..."
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?	No.
Mafhkin oble groop...	Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?	Numbers? No, never mind.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.	You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?	Indeed.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.	Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.	Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
That's a lie!	You never worked Berlin...
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.	Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
To who?	Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You promise?	Cross my heart.
They're coming!	How many?
What are you serious?	Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Eight dollars.	That's not bad.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.	This gonna get you in trouble?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?	I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
Do you know why I went after Justine?	She was there...
I agree, Baron.	Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.	You really don't remember anything that happened?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.	Ch...
I should go with her, Sandy.	Go ahead.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.	No.
This is good.	I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?	Yes sir.
Leave him!	You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
It's game time.	Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
You mean...	That's right -- premature ejection.
Sure, I think it's swell.	Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Yes.	Can I see it?
You know who.	No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Speaking of which...	Yeah, yeah.
What do you want, then?	Nothing.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?	What?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?	On what you pay me?
Really?	Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...	34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.	Light?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?	No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Oh, yes. Thank you.	There's one more thing, Austin.
Obviously.	<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Does he win?	He's a good customer.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?	Yep.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Yes, sir.	Looks good. How much did it cost?
Got a cause?	Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.	I'm helpin' you, huh?
Gerald.	Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.	What makes you think I'm not?
"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""	Who is the boss?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?	Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.	It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
I can't go nowhere.	Why?
The world needs dreamers, son.	What?
Under <u>water</u>?	High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Where did you come from?	Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You dial nine to get out.	Of what?
This?	Yeah... too bright...
How about chargin' the battery?	That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Are you sure you're not tired?	Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?	So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!	That's good.
Got it.	Stay cool.
Are we going to argue?	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.	Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.	That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Closet.	Charming.
What news of the north?	Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.	When are you coming home?
Where is she?	Gone.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.	It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Hal?	Yes.
I bet you did lots of bad things.	What are you talking about?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.	You mean she's not coming back?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....	I may call you worse than that.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...	Now, hold up.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?	Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Cole, we've got to talk.	Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.	Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.	Not likely.
Uncle Frank?	Yeah Jimmy?
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.	Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
I need someone to translate for me.	My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Did he say anything to you?	No... It must have been Bourne.
A movie *outside*?	Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.	Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Then it's war?	Yes.
"""My""..."	"Now we're on the right track... Put back ""dear""... How does it read?"
I am prepared to do that anyway.	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
How long will you set it for this time?	I thought ten years.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?	You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.	Well, what you might try is --
What you did is dead wrong.	Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.	All our friends...
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.	I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.	We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?	No. That makes you keep searching.
What anger?	About the ballet.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.	You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.	Let me take the lead, Stephen...
I'm Randy.	I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.	Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.	He drank it hot?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?	I don't know.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.	Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
What are you trying to do to me?	We want to help...!
Uh huh.	Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.	Okay.
Because it's not.	Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.	That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Here you go, baby.	Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.	Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Maybe.	Simon, what are you saying?!
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.	Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
How many?	I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
So why did you come to my casino?	I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
How do I leave here?	The front door is open.  Will you be back?
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.	I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Okay.	I treated you better.
Much better this morning, thank you.	Got a handkerchief?
Where are we going?	I'm coming with you.
The good stuff.	Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Rules are made to be broken.	Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?	Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.	Yes, well...
David! Where on earth have you been!?!	I'm freezing.
Gary, don't worry, we --	Just do what I'm asking!
What happened to your eye?	I am so sorry.
I'm working on that soccer story.	Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
What?!	I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.	Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.	For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.	Same old story.  Not interested.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.	Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?	So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
That's so long ago, I don't remember.	Will I see you tonight?
"""But"" what?"	But...
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?	Heck, no!  What?!
"Pitcher. ""Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."""	Really.
I don't get it.	When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.	That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.	Still, it must be kinda rough.
... sorry...	First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
Oh, I'm sure it will!	Then forget it.
Yeah, one of my favorites.	You made the front page.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.	How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Patrick? Is that you?	Hello? Jean, I need help!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.	It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
What happened to him?	I don't know. He moved away.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?	1002.
I... but I...	You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Two of us might be more effective than one.	I work alone.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.	Well, he's a good soldier.
Could you get here without any trouble?	Yes, I should think so.
Could be.	And if it ain't cleaned off?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!	That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
If he can do it, yes.	Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Four times... so far.	Can anyone else see him?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.	What a mess.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...	Jesus...
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...	Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?	You're entitled to your opinion.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?	You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Yes?	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.	It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Yes, why?	He was in the bank yesterday.
"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""	No...
I heard what happened.	Were the flags for Teddy?
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?	Yeah...
One more time in English.	For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
You too?	We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.	Pleased to meet you.
Permission granted.	May I ask, where are you bound?
You were little Jesse James when you left.	But you got big!
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?	Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Ready?	Keep them out of my way.
You drive.	What?
Why'd I do what?	Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Really?	Well, I didn't want to assume.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.	-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?	No!  Nothing happened.
We?  You've taken it?	We all did.
John loves the house.	Do you?
If I was still alive, I probably would.	You look awful.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.	Oh.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!	So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
That bad?	Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
That's not --	You interested in a little work?
You do good work, Alice.	So did Dan.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.	It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
It's makes it easier. Okay.	I don't want to know.
Yeah.	Here's twenty-five thousand.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!	I don't have time... I need to know.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??	Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Yes.	Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
What is the service, sir?	There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
You're what?!	I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.	There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?	My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Where's that?	Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
I feel better. Do you?	Yeah, I do.
Yes.	The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
That's why little things mean so much to him.	I LOVE THIS!!
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.	Kiss me.
You had the whole human race pegged.	Probably.
Oh, naw. Hi.	This here's Loretta.
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!	You liar!
Did he say who?	No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?	Did he tell you how we finally met?
"Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one ""Liza"" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me."	Your parents'd kill you.
So, what do you do?	It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Where is my son?	Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
They're your favorite flower.	How did you get so many?
What?	Saw him do it?
Gertrude!	You can't be Herr Mozart!
No.	Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.	You mean -- break in?
Lisa.	You know my name.
Say, David...	I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.	Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
I'm a toy to her.	A toy?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.	What's going on down there?
Yes, I do.	What is it?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.	I believe they will deport you.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.	And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
I've got to go.	No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Please don't make me say it again.	No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
It's important.	If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?	No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?	Yes.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.	Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Your whores never showed up.	They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
My German's a little rusty.	It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Sandy?	Go ahead!
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.	Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.	You're welcome.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?	I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.	And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.	My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Once more!	You upstart!
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.	Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?	Lucky, I guess.
How long will you give me?	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
See you.	See you, Bob.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?	He's up with your father.
They're taking your command, aren't they?	The Senator...
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.	We'll speak soon.
That's not	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?	Of course.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.	Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!	Huh?
'Think I should buy some originals?	...Do I?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.	Hello
And the ocean!  A mountain range!	--do as I say!
Are you Herr Mozart?	That's right.
She's such a long way home for you.	Time, I've got plenty of.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.	Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.	My condolences.
Who am I supposed to be?	This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
You need to get a haircut.	What?
'Our revels now are ended.'	Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."	Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, very big, a giant.	I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...	Now -- er --
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.	No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.	Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.	I've tried to change her mind.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.	I want him.
Um, no.	Let's move into this neighborhood.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?	Keep it up.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.	Yes, ma'am.
Is it all fugasi?	No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.	Right, Skipper.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?	No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Don't... don't say that to me...	Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?	Around...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.	Ring?
Then... I guess you have to.	There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --	I lied. Wait for it...
No, sir, he is not.	He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Fortunately, they did.	Well, I'm glad about that.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.	That's very funny, that is.
Some, everyone does.	Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
No kiddin'. Well...good night.	Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Good god.	Yeah.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?	Yes.
But -- why?	You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.	Well. It's good to see you.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.	Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.	Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.	See ya.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.	Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.	You enjoy it?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.	Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.	You mean the falsely accused?
It's about my salary cheques.	Yes?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?	I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
Wholesome.	Unwelcome.
Two weeks.	What's the pay?
Something funny, Levi?	I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
There's not enough time.	Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."	Dad!
Take care, Wade.	You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Pick me up?	Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
It's not that.	What then?
I feel bad for his family.	Yeah.
Do you have your own room?	We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.	At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.	That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Any of 'em any good?	Naah. All stable.
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...	None too discreet, is he?
I'm not drunk...	We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.	You don't believe me?
Join the party, fellas.	We're just going over a few things.
I thought so. Where's your husband?	At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
Not in the Nineties.	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
I didn't shoot West --	Yeah, we know, Pike did.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.	What the hell are you doing?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.	What did you do with her body?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --	I didn't do anything --
It is day, of course, Freya.	Is it summer or winter, Erik?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?	Maybe it's just the light.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...	I just talked to her.
Oh, come on, just a little.	I'm ready to make you another deal.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.	And the girls?
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.	Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Jesse, are you awake?	Mmmm.
"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?"	I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.	He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Nobody's that unhappy.	Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.	How did I look?
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.	Thank you.
Are you in trouble, son?!	I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
You fucked us over.	The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.	I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.	When will Strader return?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.	Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.	And the pennies?
What?	I'll see you there.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?	I was dreaming again?
Who is he?	I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?	Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Please don't tell my daddy.	My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
This one's history. Moving on...	The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Do you have a boyfriend?	No, not really.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.	Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
What do we do now?	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...	Nothing.
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this --
It was a wolf.	What?
That ain't funny.	DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Yeah.	Bang!
"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."	No one else heard it?
Yes, go on.	Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.	He said to follow him.
Shit! What are we gonna do?	Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
It's no big deal.	You are such a sweetheart.
What are you saying?	Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
We'll be there.	Goodnight.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.	Yeah, no duh.
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--	Shut-up...
If he crosses the bridge, it is.	There must be another way!
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.	You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?	Nobody.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.	You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
I don't know.	Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.	Okay.
Yes. I went to jail.	Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
My little Web did that?	Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.	I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
Where's Charlie?	Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Alice!	Daddy...
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.	How long?
What are you talking about?	If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.	SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.	I know.  Is *that* nothing.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.	So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...	You gonna sing me somethin'?
Hey, Eve!	"Have you ever heard the saying, ""He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"""
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?	Have a look at this.
I'm sure he's busy.	Don't you even want to ask?
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?	No. I --
Nah, why should you?	I don't even watch TV.
I don't know why you stayed.	Please... don't start with me.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.	That's it?
Go away, unless you got my money.	It's me, Peerless.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...	I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
About NOT raping you...	You DON'T like it, do you?
The American? Yes, duck.	How did he look?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.	You didn't have to do this.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.	But we made a deal.
What do you mean?	Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.	Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.	I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Right now.	Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.	One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Your address?	Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Well?	I'm with <u>you!</u>
Your men knew the risks.	What is going on here, man?
What!	We need more bars!
When? How?	I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?	I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I don't want to be alone.	You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.	No. He did not.
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!	Escorts!
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?	Let's just say he burned me once.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.	I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.	You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.	What, again?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.	Impossible.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?	Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Weirder than this?	Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
I don't know.	Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Ho!	That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.	So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.	Say what, Manray?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.	It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?	That's exactly what I am.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.	You look like... Brian.
We're gonna be late again.	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
What generation are you?	Nexus - 6.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
We have a lot in common.	You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.	Then you think it might have worked out?
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --	Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.	Just thought his work should go on.
Rain.	And a little ice.
Don.	So...you hang out here a lot?
Oh, our relatives... the children.	The children! May I see?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?	Shut up.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.	No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
He has?	Yeah.
Dies y nueve.	Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?	The clerk?
No!	Yes!
Uh...	What?
Did they say anything about my family?	They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
I thought only hookers drank those things.	Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
There are limits?	The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?	What?!
I don't want to go --	Fine.
Now, my flower, do you understand?	Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
What's this?	Let go...
Very cool. Trippy.	I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Look, you cocksucker...	Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
I don't want to go.	Go where?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.	Shh.
I still don't understand --	From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Yes.	Why?
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!	Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...	What?
I was a successful model once.	For magazines?
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.	Is that busy husband of mine busy?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.	I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
I plan to grow on you.	You're off to a late start.
It's stopped.	What?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?	Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.	Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.	You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?	No.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?	One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
I thought it was my turn.	It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --	It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.	Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.	And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.	Oh. What's wrong now?
Okay...	My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Is he all right, papa?	Yes, he's fine.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.	What?
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"	Just for now.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.	Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
When will this happen?	Soon. Time is almost up.
Tonight then.	My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Of course.	Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?	Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
I'm not saying that.	Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?	I don't want to.
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.	I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
Our faithful friend is still there.	Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
He got his deer yet?	No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
How old are you?	Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?	Not quite.
I guess I should go.	I want you to stay with me.
Yes.	Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?	Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.	Two hours a day, six days a week.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.	What was that?
What shows?	Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.	But it's not true.
Day after tomorrow.	Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
What was that D.J.'s name again?	Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I keep the heat on.	That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.	It's just insurance.
What do you want to know, Evan?	It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
"I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing ""Amos and Andy.""  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain."	To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.	Time to start talking.
Yeah.  A long time ago.	They're harder to do than they look.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.	Is Miss Dugan well?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
No.	"It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, ""It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."	I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...	The Judgment is ours!
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?	Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
What do you mean grammar?	The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.	Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?	It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?	Eight dollars.
It look nicer then home!	What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
Oh, hey, Patrick.	Hi, Mary. How's it going?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.	Jack?
There's one major hole in your story.	Which is?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.	Is it drug related?
Sixty days?	Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
What happened to you?	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Patrick -- is that- a.	Perm?
Are you sure?	I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.	Hi.
Three of us will never fit in there!	Oh, yes you will...
On a lot of lithium?	Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?	I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
Oh no. I have no plans.	Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Elaine, we have to go back.	We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?	I figured you share information.
You never mentioned his mental state.	He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
What's that?	My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.	Are you sure?
But it's...	Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
What?	I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""	Good MORNING!
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?	What d'you mean?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?	Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
No, Mother.	And keep your sword greased.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.	That's stupid.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?	I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
We eat when I say we eat.	Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
"He was always so ""nice""! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! ""Nice"" is weird! Nice is...what is ""nice""? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?"	I don't know. I like to think so.
Then after that it's safe.	It's safe.
Evelyn?	Yes, darling?
That's right.	My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.	You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.	But it ends up the same.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.	Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
What are you saying?	I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!	I knew you'd like him.
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!	My, my...
Five.	I make it six.
Where are we going, Frank?	Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
REALLY?	Really.
Does he know you know?	He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!	Would you like a tranquilizer?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.	Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.	Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
What's that, sir?	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?	Discreetly.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.	It's battle I want, not talk.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.	I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
Hi.	It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Let's go.  Him first.	Nick, you can't do this.
I don't know. I like to think so.	Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
All right, how's the new partner?	High spirits, desire, commitment.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.	Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
No.	No what?
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.	I'm going now, Cole.
You know what I'm saying.	If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?	No, but we're about to.
Here you go, buddy.	What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?	Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Try again.	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
What do you know of my husband?	I know he left you behind.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.	Describe him.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.	I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Oh, no!	What?!
Did you ever...	Of course not. I was married to your father.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.	Who?
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.	But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.	Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
What?	I don't know... I think I missed something.
Near the casino.	In the casino.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.	You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?	Uh-uh.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?	You'll see.
I don't want to hear it.	How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.	What kind of story are they going to believe?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.	"I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, ""the kid's a prodigy."" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?"
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?	I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
He just wants to --	-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.	Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
What happened to your face?	Got in a little accident.
Do you have me?	I think so.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.	That would have made an impression.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this...
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.	But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Do you like it?	I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?	I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Yes, you do.	And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
And the girls?	Just girls. What are you drinking?
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?	Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
You're crazy --	You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Thanks.	American Cheese. The king of road food.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.	Haven't you already done a bit of that?
You're drunk.	You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
"Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on ""Page Six"" at least."	I think his family wants this kept quiet.
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!	You killed my... my...
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.	I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.	Where am I?
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.	Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.	If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?	Yes, sir.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.	Why not?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.	It's okay. I want to talk to you.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.	All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
We check every four days.	Why four? And not three or five?
Do too little you'll die.	Going to die anyway.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?	Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?	Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?	First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Where... how'd you hear that?	CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.	Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
"I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, ""the kid's a prodigy."" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?"	Can't say.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.	I wish I didn't love you so much.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.	Oh, yeah.
"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"	What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!	Oh God, I'm dead...
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?	I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?	Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
I don't know.	What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
I'll consider it.	And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.	Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.	Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.	And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Who?	The man. He's here.
Whoa. What?	We're going to give him the money back?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.	You like mysteries that much?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.	Have you got your passport?
Oh!	A Turkish brothel.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.	Not Vanity. He's a homo.
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!	We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!	There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
I did. You said, things were fine.	I remember.
I didn't know that.	Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?	We stay down here.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --	Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.	Is that Buckethead?
Louder.	Aaagh! Rape!
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over	Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
He got a little jealous.	I'm sorry, I didn't...
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --	-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.	That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
What is this?	Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
This here's Loretta.	"I tell Annette, I says, ""You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall.""  You guys want a beer?"
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.	Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Oh?  You've tried?	Well, I do a little drawing --
See you later, alligator.	'kay.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.	Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?	With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?	Hopefully.
Sir, you threw out page two.	Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.	No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
No.	He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
I thought you were punishing me.	Why can't we agree on this?
Was it funny?	To us it was.
Thirty years. Maybe more.	How would you describe him?
You're inhuman.	I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
Then how is time travel possible?	It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?	No it's not!
Bonanza Jellybean?	What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
Yeah. Cool.	"""The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."""
You okay?	Great.  Really.
Could you grow cinnamon?	I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.	Isn't that special?  Patrick?
I was ahead of my time.	"You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for ""Brian McCaffrey, Fireman""..."
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.	Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.	Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
I see.	But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!	I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.	We check every four days.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.	Oh, yeah...?
I need a diameter approximation.	Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
Just thought his work should go on.	"He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said ""The answer's not in the box, it's in the band."" Know what it means?"
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?	Nothing. I'm fine.
Next.	Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
No thank you.	Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!	You borrowed money from your mother?
You're talking about complicity.	I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.	How are you?
How old are you?	Twenty-eight.
New York.	Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.	She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.	And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!	The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
What do you mean?	Feel this.
But where?	I have to return some videotapes.
But if it does.	You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.	What's your cut?  How much?
What?	Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
Do you have coffee?	In the kitchen.
She had you tempting fate.	My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
Yeah? Have a brandy?	Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...	In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
...Hi.	Does it get any better or what!
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.	Yeah, you told me that later.
I've never LOVED anybody!	I've never been to bed with anybody!
The dishes are juiced up, too.	Thank God.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.	Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Not if I shoot first!	I don't even think you have a gun!
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?	Next Saturday?
How fortunate.	It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I can't just walk away!	You can't just walk in, either.
Is it your software?	Is it your dish?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?	Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
What business is you in, Homer?	Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?	So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
You sure?	No problem.
I love that car.	I'm very happy for you two.
I didn't like her.	You didn't like her!?
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!	I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
That's what we're going to find out...	I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.	It's not.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.	You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.	I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Why didn't you tell me?	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Excuse us, dear.	It's okay, Dan
You'll get Ich killed.	No one's keeping him here.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.	Let go of my arm...
Mrs.?	I'm separated.
Could you watch Jango?	No.
They're prisoners to their genes.	So are dogs.
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!	Help!
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?	The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
And the bodies?	You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
So what? We hide, right?	What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...	Forget it.
You promise you'll write.	Every day.
Well, there's the possibility of...	Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Now how's your memory doin'?	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I said, I'm sorry!	If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Do you like that?	Yes.
Hey, what are you doing?!	I know a short-cut.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?	Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.	I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.	Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.	I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Yeah... I know the routine.	You are married?
Ohhh...	How is your tea, John?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?	In due time.
Where to?	Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
What about down?	I...don't know!
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.	They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.	Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?	Last February?
Know what?	That I didn't leave you there to rot.
So if you detonate in...	...nine seconds...
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?	Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Oveur.	Dunn.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.	I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I've questioned him.	Marcus?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.	Really?
It is my only object.	To make me wretched in two weeks.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.	Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Do you know how you will use him?	Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!	"""The Strawberries""?"
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?	They like Dr. Pepper.
Gotta go.	Where?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.	That's because most of it never happened.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.	My pleasure.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --	What do we do?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.	Who is... we?
You take her to a doctor?	No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
What time did you get in?	Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Me and my dad.	Where is he?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.	I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.	Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.	If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.	I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.	Then you yield to me.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
Oh yeah, why?	'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Thanks.	Black?
Where the fuck are you going?	We'll find it. Just calm down.
Last hand.	Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.	Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Of course.	Thank you.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.	Yeah, or turn you into toast.
Here I am, Father.	Take a letter.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...	Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
You know what?	What?
What?	Your father is dead.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!	He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
How we doing, Colonel?	We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Save some for tomorrow.	Catch another fish tomorrow.
I might be making a mistake.	Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Thought you had a man for that.	I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.	What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.	How much?
Hello... ?	I'm here.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.	Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Does he know that?	Oh, yes.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?	People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.	All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?	Sir, yes, sir!
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.	Why 're you doing this?
Ain't gonna be moved?	Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
This spring.	Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.	Oh fuck!
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.	That's horseshit and you know it.
-- Will he keep his word?	He always has.
So... that's it?	The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
What's the matter?	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
No! Let go, Snorri!	I've got you!
Listen, Scooter --	No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.	So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
...my... home?	Yes, John.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.	Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Who are these guys?	Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Uh. Do you like England?	Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.	But...
Bent?	Bent.
Yes.	Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
You could give somebody a concussion.	Let me feel that.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.	My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --	Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Can't.  Need water.	You've had today's water.
Well, this is just fucking great...	"It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the ""Send?"" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin."
Come on Dorothy.	What if Frank came over here and found us?
Fallacy.	The duck?
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.	Oh, thank you, sir!
Why not?	Something back home?
Is it over?	They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.	-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.	He drinks.
Doing what?	Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Sir, yes, sir!	In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.
You talking piffle, son?	Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.	You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...	It won't work like that.
You can't make it.	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
You've been married twice --	It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Lucky girl.	I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?	Well, there's the possibility of...
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?	Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!	Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.	Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Are you the proprietor?	And who might you be, sir?
Might be different in New York.	Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.	A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.	You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.	The last one you'll ever see.
We just want to check your pack --	Why?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?	I don't fuckin' cook.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?	I'm not...
Jesse.	Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Parker.	Sir?
Don't go playing policeman.	What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.	I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.	I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.	What for?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.	Bob, that makes no sense.
Not going to open?	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Why?	We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Mommy, please don't call me that.	Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.	Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.	Ha, ha, ha.
You said...	I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
What is your uncle's name?	O'Grady.
I'm sorry.	What for?
Let him go, Stan. I can help.	Go.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.	Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?	No. Black.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?	I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.	He's in interrogation?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.	I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Where do you think you're going?	You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Mind your own business, Peaches.	Sorry, Homer...
I'm not a cop.	You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?	That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Yeah! That's thinking.	"He was always so ""nice""! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! ""Nice"" is weird! Nice is...what is ""nice""? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?"
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.	It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You the new guy?	So they tell me...
Poor fucker my ass...	You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.	What are you saying?
Well you started it.	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Papa?	Yes?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.	If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-	Oh no, I'm okay.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?	Don ' t you even dare. . .
Didn't kill anything, did I?	A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I haven't seen you around here.	You just haven't been looking.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?	Yeah.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.	Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Yes?	Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
You're kidding.	No. I'm not.
Rick, I'm concerned.	About what?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?	In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
No.	Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Fine. How's everything going?	Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Was she one of your teachers?	No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Nope - just came by to chat	We don't chat.
That's right.	Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
I don't really know how --	Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Just...say...no!	What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?	He's doing his best.
What?!!	It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
You know, for when you travel.	For when I travel?
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.	Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
One more, eh?	I gotta piss.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...	Buy it from me?
Energy shielding positive function.	Do you remember the detonation time?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.	Oh, yeah.
Sir...	Thanks.
That's wonderful!	Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?	Yes.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.	Lemme take a look.
I'll not going without my family.	Yes, sir.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?	Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?
What's that?	Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.	I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.	Wonderful!
It's not that.	I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...	Sir?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.	Why?
We're all like that.	Are you religious?
When will his trial be?	Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Twenty-eight.	I'm twenty-seven.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.	I will.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!	Get buckets!
Where's my family?	We're handling it, sir.
Hello.	Connor, is that you?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.	What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
My bill.	No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.	I don't know any jokes about your name.
Here, use mine.	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.	No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
There is nothing we can do...	Helpless...
It's an apartment.	Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Really.	Yes.
Have you consulted a psychic?	No.
I don't know. Come on.	Come on, where?
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...	... and now?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.	Who says she's a suspect?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.	So what are you gonna do about it?
But how are we gonna --	We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
"Also...stay out of the ""Adult Bookstore."""	Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.	The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.	I'm busy.
This is nuts.	Wade.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.	And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
But not the only victim, right?	My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
Playing hooky again?	Feel like the dog's dinner.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.	That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Prosit.	Prosit.
It didn't go off.	Oh, God...
I know. It won't go unnoticed.	There'll be red flags.
Please, I must get out here.	Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Great bathing suit.	I think I screwed that one once.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.	You're done.  End of story.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?	Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?	Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.	I'm fine.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.	Oh, that's nice.
How did you know --	I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Do you have to swear all the time?	Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.	Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.	Yeah? What's his name?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.	In love?  With who?
Roger.	We all set?
Why am I alive?	Are you disappointed?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.	He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.	Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.	The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.	Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
No thanks.	I meant me.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.	I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...	Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'	I let her take a shower.
How 'bout this?	Still drawing a blank.
We had to finalize the deal.	Everything looks in order.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?	There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.	Our expenses?
He's out.	I know he's out, but how's he doing?
I don't believe it.	Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
We'll pretend it never happened.	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
But he killed a lot of men, too.	Can't argue that.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.	Just go!
What's the matter with you?	You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Yeah.	I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?	I don't wanna talk about it.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.	Pecos Bill.
What'd he get?	Pretty much everything.
I think you should go now.	Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
I quit two days ago, Brian.	What'll you do?
That really happened?	Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.	Tough day?
So what do I tell this guy?	Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.	Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.	Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.	We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
I... I... KILLED her...	That's my boy!
What difference does that make?	My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.	That's what I told her. My wife.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.	Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Do you swear you didn't know?	I swear.
What shall we do?	Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.	Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.	From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.	Meaning?
Oh yes.	Who are they of?
She's not a...	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Can I hold him?	Sure.
You think so.	You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?	With identification.
And Laszlo?	Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.	Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.	What about relatives?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.	One thing at a time, Laz.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!	Okay!
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.	If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?	What do you want to know, Evan?
We've got sixteen dollars.	That's not correct.
Are we here?	Yes.
About goddamn time.	Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?	Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
What a stupid idea.	Why?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.	Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Um... can dad come this time?	You know the answer to that.
How do you feel?	All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Ah, love again.	But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Let's go.	Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
I knew you'd like him.	Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?	You didn't say anything about my hair.
I want him back!	So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."	I'm going back.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.	A bustier?
My car's in the garage.	Maybe another time.
Who?	Debbie.
No.	No what?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.	You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Certain?	Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.	And I said I would never leave you.
You can go now.	I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.	Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.	That's right.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.	I was making a point.
Fuck you!	Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.	Sure.
You chickenshit punk...	Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.	The point is, they want a man inside.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?	Okay.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.	You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
But why would they --?	"You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make ""sense."" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much."
Get out	You are throwing me out.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...	They are... with me...
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.	I have my orders.
Thank you for accepting.	Thank you for inviting.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...	I'm telling you it's not that.
Yeah?	Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.	Huh?
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.	This town sucks.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.	I can see.
You hear that?	Cornelius..
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.	Are we locked up?
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.	You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
I just found a picture of you.	How do I look?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.	Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Yes, I know that sweetheart.	Are you coming to my party?
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --	I'm glad you called.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?	Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.	Dickhead?
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!	I planned on catching him, Captain.
May I try it?	Majesty.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!	You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.	C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
New hitman wants to leave his mark	That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The what?	Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Never drive again!	You said it would be easy!
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?	That's true
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.	I just want to be alone.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.	You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Mr. King, I think --	Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Nah...	Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.	Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.	Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?	You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
I don't know what that means.	Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Yes.	What if I told Frank that you opened me?
The antenna has to be replaced.	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.	Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Yes.	How're ya fixed for ammunition?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.	I'm nervous, too.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.	Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Your basic hodge-podge.	Hardly...
Back-up.	Get rid of it.
So who's going to know?	My brother.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.	Oh, that would be wonderful!
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier	But the right guess on this is arson.
That's alright... I understand.	No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.	And the same age Web was. No.
Has he?	In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
You're compulsive.	Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.	That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
He's on vacation.	We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
You certainly have a nice place here.	Well stocked.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?	If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Look, I bagged it last week.	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.	What happens if I want to sneeze?
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.	You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Not quite. This is my field.	Is there anything that isn't?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	Are you sure it's an opera?
Not particularly.	Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
How was she?	Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.	You need to get out more.
"""Hell up here?""  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."	"Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  ""Boy?""  Did you say you were a ""country boy?"""
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?	Well...
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.	Jack, please go away. Please go away.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.	Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
What are you talking about, asshole?	Your whores never showed up.
I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!	Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
You use two alternating, don't you?	We do.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.	How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
You've been avoiding me.	Have I?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.	That's what I was afraid of.
Oh? Have I seen it?	I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?	This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.	I'm on it
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.	It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!	You... oh god, why?
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.	Perhaps.
No, not at all.	I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
It's a full moon. Where is he?	At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.	"We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to ""Brown Bess."""
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.	Thanks for the insight.
Who is Machine?	I don't know...
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --	Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!	She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.	Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?	Yes.
Shut up.	Beeeee careful.
What the hell?	Yoo hoo, bomb...
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.	How much?
Where is he?	He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
How long are they going to hold him?	I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.	The good stuff.
Tish-I'm-tee.	Eat
I'd never get an abortion.	Why not?
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Why do you think he did it?	It got to be too much for him.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?	I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I've never seen a lobster.	Really?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.	I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.	That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.	Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
And I'm the feet.	Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.	Anyone particular in mind?
Do you like my body?	Sure I do.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.	Oh you do, huh?
You saved Kendall's life --	But not Pike's.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!	Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
You don't understand anything.	I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
Yes, it is.	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Tom, where are you going --	Home, I'm done.
What difference will it make?	Just wait here.
I never knew you smoked.	You never noticed.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.	You trust me?
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...	You're gonna help us take him.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?	I'm about to, Mr. President.
Do you have any hot soup?	No.
Originals?	Yes.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.	What if he's on the level?
Hello?	Put that phone down!
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?	Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Her name's Hannah.	Is that Jango?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?	...Something like that. Yeah.
You look splendid, John.	Thank you very much.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?	I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.	Like hell.
Thank you, Basil.	Oh, and Austin...
Naomi.	On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
It means a lot...that you came.	I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.	I will, sir.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?	Sure.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...	That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.	I'm sorry.
I don't have one.	Oh.
I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.	I guess so.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.	One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.	Amnesia?
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.	How much did they get from the safe?
Then I wasn't beautiful.	You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
What do you want?	Who is Machine?
Sorry I hit Jackson.	He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Yes?	Order me a pastrami for after?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.	You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.	Sorry.
There's no rule!	Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Please, mom. People will talk.	I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
In the world.	I know you just want to punish me --
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.	Not an easy day to forget.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.	Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.	That's not mine.
How?	Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Sir, yes, sir!	Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Strange. I know so very little about you.	I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
I know you just want to punish me --	I do. I want to very badly.
A resort city, Beppu.	I want to go talk to him.
Yeah, we promise.	Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Yeah, you did!	Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.	Die tomorrow or die today.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.	Right.
What the fuck is going on here?	What. What's the matter?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?	Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.	You? Why?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?	Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Who?	Twombley.
MAYBE WHAT --	Maybe he...
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.	Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Alright, suit yourself.	He's comin' back? What for?
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.	Valentine, listen to me ...
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.	I see.
So what now?	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
What color is it?	It's blue. Blue velvet.
What are you going to do about it?	What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.	I'm a what?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.	Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.	You left out condescending.
Big enough.	It's illegal, Nick.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.	It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
Leave me alone.	I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
So what's up with you and DeLa?	What do you mean?
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.	Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.	Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
What happened?	Honey. What were you doing with that?
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.	Not quite.
Hello? You there?	Y-Yes my son.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.	I don't want to use it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.	I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Then shut up.	My place.
How's it going?	Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!	Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Aaagh!	Got you!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.	Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
Twist of lemon!	Chief, what the fuck is this?
A bully? Moi?	That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I like your stories.	And I like you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.	I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.	Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Yeah.	That's another thing I can't do.
What've you got there?	Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.	You seen my snake-skin shoes?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?	Why? What's in Lisbon?
Am I interrupting something?	Not at all.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.	What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.	Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.	It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
We were attacked by a werewolf.	I'm not listening!
Where?	I want to go back to Vienna.
Where did you go to school?	I was at Beadles.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?	No.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.	So that's what you been doing?
Great, great. That's fantastic.	It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
You leave something out?	After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.	I didn't mean it to sound like that.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.	What's baseball?
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.	He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?	So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Jesse, we got to have a word.	Sure, cousin.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?	"""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.	Then Elaine was right.
He knew all along.	What??
It's just a trifle, of course.	May I try it?
We're working for the King.	Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?	I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Really?	Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?	I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Why should we care?	Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Yes...	Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Don't we have any chopsticks?	Oh, right. Hold on.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?	I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!	Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Well?	Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Absolutely not.	Toss you for it.
I'm sorry I'm late.	Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..	Corn-i-Lius?
I can't do it, Jani.	I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
You said it would be easy!	I was wrong!!
How did you manage it?	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.	Oh yeah, that's good.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?	Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Not if it works.	And what in your estimation works?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!	Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
"Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.	I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.	Yes, papa.
Thank you... very much.	Where did you get this box?
Same old story.  Not interested.	Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.	Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Queen Harry?	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Not since we were kids.	I've stopped a hundred times.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --	Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.	Oooooo.
You know what for.	No I don't.
Yes.  That follows.	But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
We said 48 hours.	That's a long time to be in jail.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!	I'm *not* a doctor!
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.	I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...	Jack, are you okay?
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!	I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
That obvious, huh?	Then you saw him, too?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.	Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Feels so good to lie here.	Get up, damn you.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.	You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.	You decided.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.	Thanks, Stan.
And you can only do it once, right?	That is correct.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.	I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
What do you think? Is he coming in?	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.	Headquarters!? What is it?
Bullshit --	Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Really? Is he cute?	He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.	And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.	Stop.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?	Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.	Dude Finlay?
But why my name, Richard?	Because you're getting on that plane.
Scream.	Ah.
A brothel.	Oh!
Any luck?	Plenty, but it was all bad.
What a creep.	And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!	You're losing your temper!
Why?	Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.	What do you chant?
I think two million.	What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.	Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
About...	About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Jeffrey!!	Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Anything harder?	There's nothing harder.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.	Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...	She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
May I have a word with you, please?	Sure.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.	Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Naw!	Go ask him.
I want you to look at this.	What is it?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.	Up where?
I could save you the trouble.	No trouble.
I regret it is not too familiar.	Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
All right, Austin, I think you should go.	I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
"""The Last Unicorn!"" By Samantha Darko."	Donnie! Give it back!
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.	No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I'm gonna propose.	When?
Pretty much everything.	The grandfather clock?
Do you want to talk about it.	I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I did it! I did it! We won!	We won?!
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.	C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.
What happened between you and the blonde?	What?
Jeffrey, when you see your father.	Yeah?
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.	True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.	Yeah. I know about that.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.	The antenna has to be replaced.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?	Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Really?	Mio caro Adone.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.	Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.	Did he say anything to you?
Why not? He has great pants.	I just don't want to.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.	What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Well, ask her!	She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Why don't you take a break, Jack.	All right, Mr Reynolds.
Yeah?	On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?	Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Yes.	Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.	Good day.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.	Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Very smart indeed.	Yes. John wants it.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.	Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?	So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.	What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
When?	Tonight. Just me.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.	Then do it.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.	It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!	You bet, Mom! Coming up!
You've never been?	Alas, no.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?	Don't try to change to the subject.
Is he good?	He's damn good.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!	I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.	Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
I wanted to see if he was okay --	You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
We was robbed.	Okay. Take her purse.
Who're these guys?	Where is he?
Thanks a lot.	This is too much. I can't handle this.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --	-- You thought what?
Is she a good fuck?	What??
What are you talkin' about?	Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?	Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.	See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.	I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.	Really -- what happened in 1922?
Enough about me, what's happening with you?	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.	I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.	He loves me, as I love you.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?	It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
It's up to you now, Angel!	I'm so tired...
Word!!!	So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
You're shaking.	It's the tension.
I'll wait... back there.	Hamish, I... thank...
It's been a long time.	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.	But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
That's horseshit and you know it.	Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...	Thank you, Steed.
You're his sister, right?	Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.	Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.	Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Stan? What's going on?	The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
What are my choices?	Choices?
You drive away business roarin' in like that.	Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.	Ain't gonna be moved?
And German?	Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
What?	There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.	Shut your mouth and drive!
Because he knows how to get to our man.	He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.	Please?
Yes, John?	...Can you cure me?
Steed ... !	Mrs. Peel ... ?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.	That's true.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.	Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.	So what? We hide, right?
What did you see?	Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
What point is that?	The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Yes?	Do you have something against science?
What about her?	No way.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.	To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.	You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.	Do you?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.	Sorry to disappoint you.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.	Yes.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.	Thank you, Exposition.
Uh, we got a problem here.	Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Yes Basil?	Be careful!
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?	No, I want my cut!
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.	Partnership?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.	Shut up.
That's too far ahead to plan.	Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.	What about the sender?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.	If I break one you gonna shoot me?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.	Very impressive.
Do you hear me?	He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.	Here.  I have your money.
Then when?	...Tonight!
Heard about this morning.	We ain't here to talk about that shit.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.	But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.	They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?	Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?	Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.	The car for Debbie?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!	It's up to us, Hamish!
No, I guess it's okay.	You sure?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.	Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.	I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.	Ma, what's wrong?
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.	And the putty around the door?
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.	Fifty, and you've got your man.
Hey, you two! What's going on?	I was sitting there.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?	Hawk.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...	She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
We have to save the world.	Good luck..
Monsieur Rick, I --	-- He's just a lucky guy.
and if that means negotiating...	You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.	We eat when I say we eat.
I'm sorry.	I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I plan to. Soon.	How soon?
How... how can you say that to me...?	Will you let me look?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.	You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.	Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...	...no, she didn't...
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.	I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
'kay.	Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
"""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"	Oh, that's the best part.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.	I never was more in earnest.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.	Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Inez, this is --	Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.	Damn. Your dad did this?
You believe?	Yes.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.	That's because it's such a nice one.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--	I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
You're Polish?	My folks are.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.	Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
It's them.	It's too late.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?	Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.	He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?	Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Sure you don't want your wallet?	Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
So then she just stops calling.	I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --	I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.	Copy, Air Force One.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.	It's my Bullworker.
Who to?	None of your business...  Take another letter.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.	What about Oleg?
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.	Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.	Why?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!	Ronnie...
See you're back and still rocking the boat.	Somebody's got to.
Keep them out of my way.	Okay.  You ready?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?	'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.	To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.	It's okay.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.	He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.	Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.	"One has to be more than ""careful"" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether."
I dropped you off after. You said --	Come up and see me... now.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.	Stop the car!
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.	Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.	Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?	They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
You are a hell of a woman.	Don't swear.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!	I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.	Simon, why has he become so... so...
So, you're looking great, how have you been?	Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Infant Memory Generators.	Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.	His name was Swifty?
Yeah, gal I been here before.	I guess you have.
What is it?!	It's Perry!
Why'd you want to help us?	Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.	No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.	Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.	He knew all along.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.	Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Really?	Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
What?	The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
That's what I thought.	You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.
You OK, Bob?	No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Those cockroaches?	Ya.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?	We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
Why - well, I	Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Range twenty meters.	Seal the door.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.	Yes, I get the point.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..	What kind of mission?
Been up with Alice.	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.	Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Ha. Ha.	Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Yyyess.	Yyess.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.	Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Ah... pity, pity...	You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
He understands.	Ask him if he will help.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?	Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Yes.	The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?	Where?
My meat and two veg.	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Sam's piano.	Serves me right for not being musical.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?	Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Oh, yes.	And he is still willing to give you a visa?
What's happened to you?	"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."
Yeah.	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.	Believed what?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...	You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.	That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.	He asked me to stay.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...	...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.	Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
You followed me.	Orders.
Come in.	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
HOLD it! HOLD it in!	DEATH TO DRAGONS!
So what are you up to now?	I'm robbing this place.
CONTINUED	Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.	No.  Poached.  Over.
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.	As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Not on him.	I'm not wearing his pants.
There was one time when I was eleven...	You were talking about your wedding.
I love her.	Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.	What happened next?
What? How long was I asleep?	The whole movie. Let's go.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.	That's easy. Antiseptics.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.	An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.	No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Don't need none.	Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Hey.	Hey. You OK?
I was?	You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.	I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
State trooper?	Fallacy.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?	Not one.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.	What way?
I don't know. What if it breaks?	What if?
Sir?	Phenomenology...
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.	Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.	Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.	Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
How much?	About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah...Yale thing.	What do you mean...Yale thing?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?	Hey, I got no choice.
Would they do that?	Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
I'm so excited, Simon.	I guess this is a first for you.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...	That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Hi, I'm Honey.	Where's Czech girl?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.	Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --	The prom?  Kat has a date?
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?	Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --	They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
What can I say, Jack?	You don't have to say anything.
You 're so --	Pleasant?
Twenty-six.	Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.	Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...	Okay, I follow you so far...
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!	I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
T-T-Thanks Alice...	Earth to Alice...
Go ahead, Bird Dog.	You're all clear.
There is something I must ask the Gods...	No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.	Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Without hope there's no point to anything.	Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
YOU SHUT UP!	Careful how you point that gun, boy.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.	Something like that.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.	I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.	Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
You probably also know that we found them okay.	Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?	You didn't tell him about me?
Morning, Sunshine...	Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Who, me? Why should it?	That's what I thought.
See. Get your boots.	Hi honey.
Like you care.	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?	Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
See that tram coming around the corner?	Yes.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.	Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Are you going to put a spell on me?	I might.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?	And I just liked you so much.
Well I don't...	Wait. He left.
"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."	A woman?
"Protest finally forced ""Amos and Andy"" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on."	Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.	Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?	I am butcher.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.	Thank God for bunge cords.
What's he doing here?	Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.	And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --	-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.	I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
I can't do that.	Why not?
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.	If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Thanks.	No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.	Did you like it, then?
What do you think?	It's too neat.
Such as?	You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
"""Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"""	"""I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."""
Wolfi! Your father is dead.	What?
Good luck..	Of course.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.	I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
How did you start the fire this time?	I used an accelerant.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.	Will you be quiet?!
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...	I told you not to read all that crap!
No.	Take it, damn it.
And you've got BOTH axes?	Yes, Mother.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --	Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.	Back in the Czech Republic?
Hi.	Hey.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.	No. I really don't.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...	I don't think you're gonna make it.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.	What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.	End my career?
I know.	If I'd known you were alive --
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.	Just poached on toast.  Over.
Those are the Hoyts.	I don't care. They're out.
Oh really? That's great.	I said we are totally booked.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?	Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?	Huh?
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.	You're a good soldier, Bill.
She's an exception..	Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Row!	Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.	Are you drunk?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.	What do you want?
No.	But in your profession that is a risk.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?	Yes.
What are you going to see?	An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Then what's stopping you?	One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
What happened?	They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
We need to talk --	Seven.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.	He had a yacht?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.	Abdul-Shabazz?
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.	Yes, sir.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.	Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.	You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Yes, Victor, I was.	I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?	What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.	It's what I do. It's my job.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.	Nice bunch of guys.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.	Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
And do you trust me?	I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.	What's the question?
Yeah.	I hear you're a good thief.
You don't want to talk about it.	No.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.	No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?	Ugh ...
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.	So you were never a prostitute?
The safe. Now.	Of course!  Uh, sir?
Is that a birthday cake?!	Yes, it is.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.	He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Do you feel that way?	No. Not really.
It's quite nutritious, sir.	Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.	Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?	Well...
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?	It's...it's...all right.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.	But this is absurd!
I know I won't be your puppet.	You can go now.
Mommy...Mommy?	Right here, baby.  Right here.
You are one sick fucker.	I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.	I'll match any man with the sword.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.	You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
"""We're"" not over-reacting."	Could you watch Jango?
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?	Epilepsy.
Stop playing me Sloan.	Just ask me what you want to know.
Yeah.	Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Exactly.	Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
Amber...	No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.	The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
My first job.	Your first assignment was Geneva.
Negative.	That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Am I disturbing you?	No... not at all.  Where are you?
I think we should go.	No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
What was inside?	Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.	I don't know what to say.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!	Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Days??	Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.	Any good?
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.	Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
My father!  He's not - ?	Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.	Bitch!
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.	Think it'll work?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.	Wow. That must've taken some courage.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?	That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!	That's true.
Tell me what to do.	The... chain helps.
I'm doing it.	Are you a bad boy?
Well, what's the topic of discussion?	The disappearance of Paul Owen.
It's bad.	It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
What would you call her?	Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.	Do me an enormous favor?
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.	That's what she is!
Were you in jail?	Maybe.
There's nothing harder.	Snuff?
I beg your pardon?	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.	Right, the big one-oh.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.	So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.	You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Alright?	Alright.
But you refused me, Dorothy.	Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.	Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
How was I ridiculing you?	You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
You think Applejack knew?	We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Sir, yes, sir!	So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Stand by.	Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!	Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.	It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.	Exactly.
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?	He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.	Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?	What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.	If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.	Are you in trouble, son?!
Yes.	Good. Or should I speak slower?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.	Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Then I shouldn't change anything?	No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?	When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
I must say, you look more your old self --	You mean my other self ...
Must be billy's girl.	Come on.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.	Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Tell me.	No. It is too judgmental.
I don't know.	I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
So they said.	How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?	Well.
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?	How can we stops him now?
You upstart!	That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?	A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.	I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.	Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.	Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?	1959.
It's time.	Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I'm gonna kill you.	Don't bore me with that bullshit.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.	So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Sire.	Well. There it is.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.	Right away, Exposition.
What is this?	A gift.
How is your tea, John?	It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
When did you first find out he was alive?	Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Who are you?	My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You saw a lot in one night.	Actually. I've been in twice.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.	I should probably write that down.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.	No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
What happened?	Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
And she bought that?	I have sincere eyes.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.	A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
"Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white."	Excuse me?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.	I don't believe it.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?	No, why don't you take care ot it?
Methuselah Syndrome.	What's that?
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?	I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Treves. Well done.	Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
What?!	He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Ichiro --	Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Hear me out...	I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.	Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
He loves me, as I love you.	Will he wish to know the details of this night?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?	Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.	You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Hey.	Hey.
Don't panic, Anthony.	I'm not. But there's --
Think it'll work?	Nah.
Aw, c'mon.	That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
You are so completely unbalanced.	Can we go now?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.	"""...did."" Well, okay."
Well, where was Patrick?	He went home sick.
It's three years old, it --	Bring it to the other location.
Detective Inspector Ross.	Who...
That hair will have to go.	Fine.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?	I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?	I've seen a few.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.	Destroy it?
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.	Yeah, me too.
So that's the one you want to marry.	With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."	An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
You've been up all night?	That obvious, huh?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.	Oh yeah?
Who's side are you on?	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
No. You lost your way.	Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.	Your father?
To the... to the beach?	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?	I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.	Yes... It's true.
Where it came from?	No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.	Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?	Forget it.
Dignan. Take it easy.	Bob!
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.	And the Landy woman?
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.	It's coming... argh! I can't!
In your opinion.	It would be my child.
To go up.	To go up.
About the ballet.	Ballet? What ballet?
You mean my other self ...	Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?	Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?	Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.	Look out of that window.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.	You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Oh shit. What is that?	A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
I know.	I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
They like Dr. Pepper.	Who are these people?
No, Captain, please.	No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
"Kayleigh? Do you ever think about ""us?"" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"	Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.	What night?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.	But Chief?  Over this??
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.	What does Starsky say?
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...	Fuck that shit.
It was Freddy.	Enough of that crap.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.	Best damn plan I heard all war.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?	Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.	That's too bad.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?	No, why?
Hi Dad.	Hey Jeff.
Oh, hi.	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.	He always look so
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.	Alive?
Well, I	I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.	This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
You set me up.	I just wanted --
So many children. Are they all orphans?	Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?	Handsomely?... Who sent you?
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!	But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?	Has he?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	No.
You don't have secrets from me.	It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
That does not compute.	Why not? It's a question.
May we proceed with the business?	With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I'll be there.	They're waitin' man.
I beat the odds!	You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
When do we arrive at Clavius?	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.	Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm gonna need more caps.	You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
I don't know.  I think so.	It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
As a plumber?!	It's easy to learn.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.	No...
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.	Tender Hegenheim.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.	Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.	Romance!
Where's the money?	In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Danger Powers, personal effects.	Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?	Itches.
Loretta, shut it.	Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.	Really?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?	That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Yeah?	A coyote.
Where is it? What did you do with it?	I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.	Come over here.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.	But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
You don't?	Nope.
I hate public transport.	What?
It's artificial?	Of course not.
So do you...been a long day.	Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.	Near the casino.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.	Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
And he'd been shot.	Yeah --
Why?  What's wrong with me?	...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Good luck.	You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Why the gun?	I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?	Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
No trouble.	Because you always obey orders ...
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?	Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Tell the Chief we thank him.	Chief knows.
What do you say, sir?	Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.	Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
"""An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."""	You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
I ain't tired yet.	Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
What do you mean - now?	Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.	How's this about me?
"""Don?"""	Don't you have any leads at all?
Why?	I'm not asking you to marry me.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.	It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?	I was thinking of selling all the cards.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.	I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Then who changed it?	I don't know.
I do!	Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.	Egad, were you horrified?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?	Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
I want my man back.	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.	Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.	Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.	You didn't become crazy.
You too.	I'm so glad you're alive.
-- where? -	-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.	Mommy, please don't call me that.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?	I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.	Yeah.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.	Are we in some kind of trouble?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...	I remember.  You just left...
We came back to the house!	You didn't stop anywhere else?!
True.	Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Doesn't look like it.	Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --	He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
What kept you?	The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?	I can handle that.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?	She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?	Certainly.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.	Gentlemen?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.	Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
You're killing me...	Don't...
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?	If they don't tell me what I need to know...
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.	She was a real asset. But what could I do?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.	No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Huh?	Fuck off, frat boy.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!	I will not accept this! Now go away!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.	Honey?
Don?	No.
Please, there's no... Oh.	I wasn't saying anything.
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!	Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!	See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.	Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.	Then you have some hot tea?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?	She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.	I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Hey, Joel --	-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.	Yeah, I'll bet.
Is there anything that isn't?	The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
One.	But...
Yes.	What time did you get in?
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.	Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Jesus...	Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Oh, my God!	He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.	Who?
CONTINUED	Did they have any explanation for this?
What flickering light?	The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...	I'll be right back. See ya later.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.	But, you know, so what?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?	What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.	It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Sounds risky to me.	You getting cold feet?
Simon.	Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Were you adopted, Bob?	Why do you say that?
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?	Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Give it back to him.	And if we can't find him?
I know what it is.	Then why did you ask me?
-- C'mon, Stephen.	-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Can I say something in my defense?	No.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...	I'm sorry, Ward.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --	How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Becky was my only shot at state!	That's enough!
And what do you do with the bones?	Dog food.
How do you know I'm not?	You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?	I've been great. And you?
Do you know him?	*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?	Open the door. We're late.
Uh huh.	That's easy. There was. He's dead.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...	Where --
Ted...	Yes?
So go.	"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain."
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.	Go ahead, Jam.
Nobody ever loved me that much.	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
I told you I've never driven before!	Never drive again!
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.	See you then.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.	Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.	Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
I actually know how this works.	You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
Rae...	I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.	How does that make you feel?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.	You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
I swear --	Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..	So, just how big was this fare?
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.	Yes, ma'am.
Yeah...	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.	You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
No.	I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
It's inside the complex.	You're just reading me.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?	Yes, indeed.
What are you doing?	Just wanted to see.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.	They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Yes, sir.	It's a full moon. Where is he?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.	Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Now?	Yes!
Papa, is this your idea?	Mine?
Yes, darling?	Is your Evian spiked?
I got scared.	I can imagine.
Excuse me, but how old are you?	Twenty-six.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.	Yeah?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.	Raw deal.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.	Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
The hell you call me?	Eh, if the bootie fits...
A Chigro?	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Rough day?	Rough life, Jack.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --	Seriously?
Why you?	I was at hand.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?	Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Let me see your cash book, will you?	Now?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.	Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.	That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
That's okay.	"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you."
Thank you.	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.	I need to talk to her.
So I've heard.	I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?	Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
What?	'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Alright, I get the picture.	He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
I get it. You can drop it now.	Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.	Grammar.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?	We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Olivier's in that, right?	Then it's on to the real thing.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.	I need another one, sir.
I was just about to have my dinner.	If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !	You don't have to do nothing.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?	Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!	Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
But...	Pull over.
His company made us.	I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Why what, sir?	Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Nice shot.	Thank you, sir.
You have very nice ceilings.	I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Could you fill me in?	Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.	Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?	I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
What are you doing?	Let's go. Come on.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.	You first.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.	This came for you, sweetie.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?	That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.	What the fuck for?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.	It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
You're now Mantan.	Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
What does he say?	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.	How?
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.	Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.	It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
You can if you want.	Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?	Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?	No. It's all arranged.
No, but	It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Gone.	You mean dead.
Oh, Jesus.	I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Pee...Per...Man.	Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?	Good question.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.	It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
You use your equipment, don't you?	So?
Who are you?	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn	The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.	So he drank himself into a stuper?
Ten years.	Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
"I see ""elegant."""	Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Yeah.	Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.	Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.	Where's the plow?
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.	This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Great	Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?	Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.	You don't usually ask.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
What are you doing?	My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Does this conversation have a purpose?	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Where's the fail-safe key?	The key!
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.	I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?	Obviously.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.	It's in my blood, Willy.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --	-- Is what?
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.	Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
So what's he doing? You believe him?	It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?	No.  Have you?
Yeah?	I'd like to... take you out or something.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?	"Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white."
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...	Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.	Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.	A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
What are you saying, son?	It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.	"Oh, that's right. You're ""clueless."""
In the chest.	No, I mean whereabouts.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!	Just get outta my bed.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.	The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.	But I have no excuse to close it.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.	You and me both.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.	I don't know anything about it.
Son?	Can we talk?
Don't bother!	What?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?	Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.	We should talk.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?	Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
Don't you know this?	I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
How long you and me known each other?	A long time.
Yeah.	It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.	Nick --
Werewolves simply do not exist.	David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?	As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Leave.  Now.	Can I say something in my defense?
I had to ask.  I apologize.	No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
"Say ""Mmmerrick."""	Mmmerrick.
How well do you remember the lab?	I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.	Okay. I'm Gary.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.	Practically no one.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.	That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
What is that?	What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.	Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --	-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
You didn't answer my question, Mum.	I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!	"I know how to say ""Hello"". Teach me how to say ""Good-bye"", that's all I need."
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.	Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?	Something like that
God exists because you're horny.	I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Hey.	Are you lost?
You can ride like that?	I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?	Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.	-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Purely for medicinal purposes.	I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
You are very kind.	Won't you join us?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?	When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
Siwash, huh?	He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...	I can't go nowhere.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.	How can you be so certain?
West was one thing, but this --	Shut up, Mueller.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.	"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""
I feel sure of it.	I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
What about Customs?	I'll worry about Customs.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.	I guess it lacks a certain style.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.	The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
Roger.	Huh?
Was I?	I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!	<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!	What direction does the system indicate?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.	Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Your work.	Thank you. I try.
The fax machines.	Excuse me?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!	You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Nobody special enough, Curly.	You mean somebody asked?
He is traveling with a lady.	He'll take one.
Sure.	In the house?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!	Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?	That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.	Excuse me?
You got any better ideas?	Mind if I ride along with you?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?	No.
I hope I'm not interrupting.	Take a seat -- you're next.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.	Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.	Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Let me repeat -- Why not?	Because you killed one of my crew.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.	Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.	Two days?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.	Seconds and thirds, too.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!	My mother's like that.
Here, have a piece of gum.	Here, have a piece of gum.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.	No.
Great.	Found a job?
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.	All right - go to it.
Where does this Sugai live?	A resort city, Beppu.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.	You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.	"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"	You'll see!
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?	C'mere.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?	It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --	Stand by, Bird Dog.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--	You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.	I wanted to see if he was okay --
Alexander Pope?	Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Red ...	... head ...
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.	Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.	Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?	Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?	What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Dr. Hirsch?	Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Let's talk Hubley.	His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...	It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
What did he say? Tell me!	He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.	I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I'm okay--I can walk.	I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Still makin' jokes?	No joke.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?	Do you have something to prove?
We heard that one already, Homer.	"""Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."""
You going to have the time?	I'll find the time.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.	Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --	All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --	It matters not, he is thy king!
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.	We need a car.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sorry, I --	Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?	Oh, I doubt that's the case.
I'm Joel.	No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
How could I not?	Did my work please you?
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.	What?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.	Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You wanted to see me!	You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?	Well, it's kind of weird.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.	Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
What?	A wolf.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?	No. No thank you.
What are you talking about?	A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
Starting to recognize a pattern?	What do you want?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.	Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
West?	Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Are you going public with this?	No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
But he killed these guys.	But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Good morning, mongrels!	Good morning...
Do you like talk like that?	No.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.	Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Number one.  She hates smokers	It's a lung cancer issue
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.	True, but--
Are you okay?	What do you mean?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.	But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Yes mother.	I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.	About what?
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.	Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.	Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?	The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
This stinks really bad.	You should have smelled me.
Itches.	Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
What is that?	Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
It looks like scurvy.	Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
We do.	Where's the magnet?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?	This is for me.
I forgive you.	Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Why?	What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!	I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Hey, you guys...	Who's your friend?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.	Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?	I can't find him.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?	To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Your honor must lower his voice.	All Europe shall hear of this!
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?	They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
I've got news for you. It's not working.	I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?	No.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.	Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.
Tower, say again!!	The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.	Okay.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.	Marion, stop this.
I'm not accusing you...	Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.	You have nine points left on your license..
You up for it?	For. . . ?
No what?	No!
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.	What's that?
What's that you're playing?	Just a little something of my own.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.	I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
It is a big deal.	I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
"Say ""Mmmerrick."""	Mmmerrick.
Put your pilot on.	He's busy being dead.
"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""	Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.	Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?	Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?	"Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him ""good luck."""
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.	I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.	Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.	I'm more comfortable around my people.
Cool!	Would you like a Coke or something?
John.	Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
I'm sorry, Newt.	You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
What about this?	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
They don't?	No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
What?	I just wish it was that simple.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?	Mafhkin oble groop...
Fine.	That hair will have to go.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?	Never before this.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?	I tried.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?	He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.	He's not Army, it's not official --
BIANCA	No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?	Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?	Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Yeah.	Let me have ten bucks?
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.	No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.	Behave!
What the hell are you talking about?	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
I'm sorry.	Me too.
I love Lucy!	You nut!
All right, they're makin' a movie.	You don't know where this is gonna...
It was a long time ago.	I know, but...
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.	They say you're in debt.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.	She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
What's this?	Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?	You told me to look, so I looked.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.	Good call. Help yourself.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?	I dunno.  Just being weird.
You came back for these?	Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.	It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.	I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?	Commes des Garcon.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.	These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Cole, what the hell are you doing?	She's mine!
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.	How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
You might be disappointed.	Why?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?	Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.	It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.	That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?	No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'	Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!	Nothing.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.	OK.
Yes, yes it is!	"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.	You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.	I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	Why?
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.	I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
I was at hand.	Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..	Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Hungry.	Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.	What are you saying?
Yes!	Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Do what?	This.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?	Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
But, David.	I wasn't hallucinating.
What happened, Doolittle?	Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
No, no, no.	I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
Is it night or day, Erik?	It is day, of course, Freya.
With the tenors.	Also identical?
Is that Donald Trump's car?	Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.	Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
I need you so much! I love you!	Wake up, William. Wake up!
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?	You tell me.  I only work here.
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.	For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.	Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
It's a five-pointed star.	Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.	The theatre?
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.	Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
I love you, Austin.	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
This floor's freezing.	Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.	Did we warn them off?
No ma'am.	Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
As a parent, that's my right	So what I want doesn't matter?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?	Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
But you haven't put in for emigration.	Nope.
Why are you staring at us?	You're just all so... so different.
Let Myrna finish.	Thank you.  And always smile.
What course, Skipper?	Right at our one-eyed friend!
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.	I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Enlighten me.	Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.	But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
That was war.	So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.	Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
I shouldn't tease a hero.	What?
I'm in till the end.	Good.  I'm going to need your support.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.	Really.
Amnesia?	Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...	You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.	Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Where is he?	He's inside you, where he hides.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.	Y'know what?
That sets it off.	No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?
Forget it.	You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...	But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Uh huh.	It looks so soft.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?	Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Exactly.	Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Will you come with me?	What?
My office.	Right.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.	If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Why she got a chain on her?	That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
That'd be my reaction too --	He's lying.
Sometimes which?	Sometimes neither.
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?
Back in the Czech Republic?	Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
SHUT UP!	Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Mr. Sampson . . .	All right. Send him in.
You've been coming in early.	It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	Right back where we started.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.	This could be a trap.
Always good advice.	For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Mozart -	Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?	...Leeloo.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.	Is that Donald Trump's car?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?	A cheap hotel.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.	They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Welt...it depends, why?	Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Why?	Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?	Something wrong?
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.	Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?	I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?	Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.	Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?	Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
No.	I can't take him to work.
Yes, of course.	You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
Annette, just use your hand.	They told me to practice.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.	He wanted more than that.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.	Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
The sets were good.	The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
How are things going at school?	I think about girls a lot.
Better than I can!	Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.	Shit!
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?	I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
It's going back down.	Applejack! What's happening?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?	I'm sorry.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.	I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.	If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!	Of course not.
Nice bunch of guys.	Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
He gots to be did.	Did he gots to be.
I don't want to drag you down with me.	Daphne, I...
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?	I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
It won't work --	It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Other than that... You all right?	...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.	Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.	Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.	Thanks for the speakers.
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.	Well, you ARE!
Is that better?	Perfect, Mr. President.
Yes. I know.	Good.
Girlfriend?	Yes.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.	Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.	So what did you find.
The grammar?	Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
The James-Younger Gang.	Sorry.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.	This is a remarkable aircraft.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?	Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.	Really?
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.	Yes sir.  What's that?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!	Take it easy, Clark.
No joke.  Serious.	Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.	He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
What?	If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --	He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
A coyote.	There aren't any coyotes in England.
I killed him???	You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Look at these. What are these?	Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Wha?	I hereby name this star Fred.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Wash it to the windows?	No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.	All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
And why should she?	Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.	Hello.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.	A sign from whom?
So. Not bored yet?	I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Ted!  What are you...?	I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Who's been giving you weird looks?	A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?	Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?	Yes... oh, yes...
"""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"""	-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?	Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Hello.	I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.	I'm on at nine.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?	You know what I'm saying here.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?	Pardon me?
No, thank you.	I'd like some tea, please.
"""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""	Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.	I will go and wake them up!
Of course.	Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.	Check out the other guy's buns.
Charming.	Bathroom.
Was.  Divorced.	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?	...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!	Whose doin' is that?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.	That's true. But what if they change the locks?
But you're the Gods!	Look... Erik...
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.	You must leave me alone on this.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?	Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Yeah.  What?	There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
You've never had any formal training, either?	Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.	A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Chief says -- he has a God.	... and also to bring medicine.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.	Where are we going?
Come on.  Crawl faster.	DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.	Good. Good.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!	Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
I don't want to cause any trouble.	I'm here, aren't I?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.	I see.
Bullshit.	It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Are my eyes really brown?	You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Why wasn't I insulted?	You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.	I've still got mine.
"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""	Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
I told you, use less powder.	But you won't get that splatter effect.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.	I've heard.
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
Yeah. No thanks.	Please. Why not?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.	Yes!
why did they do that?	Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.	It's been a long time.
I think I have no money.	It's okay.  Forget it.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.	Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
That the atmosphere processor?	Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Why is Cole here?	You know your father enjoys his company.
Of course.	What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.	Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?	That new roof, that's your doing.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?	I can't remember.
Have you seen him?	Who?
Come up to Boston with me?	Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Let's hear it.	I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.	No, but he was on the moors.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!	I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Did you learn anything?	A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.	Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Sweet love, renew thy force!	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?	Who's Ted Bundy?
No, you didn't!	I poisoned his life.
Yeah, right.	Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
It's unbelievable.	Story of my life.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?	It's three years old, it --
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.	So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.	I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
Keep the change on that.	Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.	Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.	Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.	Where's Kumar?
Where did you get it?	I. sold the car.
Oh?	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.	Did he find anything?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.	And I suppose you're the knight.
Are you sure this is a good idea?	Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Yeah. I mean that.	No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Oh, yes, please.	Go back to Bulgaria.
Do you have the suspect in custody?	Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Interesting.	Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?	Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
You're smashed, Vanessa.	I am not.
Probably.	I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
There.	Must be billy's girl.
Seventy-five hundred.	Not interested.
Are we in some kind of trouble?	No...
Pull out, goddamnit!	What do you want, Courtney?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.	Does that work?
What's to discuss?	You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What is this? What color is it?	Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?	Why -- why -- of course.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?	Yeah.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --	I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Hope their plumbing's the same.	It is.
Yes. I did.	OK, Bob.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.	I'm sorry, Bob.
Why did you take the money?	I hate public transport.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.	Do...what.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.	A card?
Be careful.	Thank you.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?	I won't be staying.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!	Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?	Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Are you drunk?	Probably.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?	Whatever gave you that idea?
"""Hmm"" what?"	"""But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."""
Because you're afraid!	No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
What makes you cry?	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Because you're making decisions for me.	As a parent, that's my right
How was I? Tell me honestly.	You were sublime.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.	I see. I thank you for your time.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.	His son-in-law damn near killed me.
You want Kendall, don't you?	He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Milo. Why would he --	"How should I know? ""Solving a problem,"" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there."
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?	I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Daffodils?	They're your favorite flower.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?	Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.	Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.	Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.	Motive. You gotta have a motive.
I don't think so.	You don't have a computer in your cabin?
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --	1922. Why the kippers?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?	Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.	He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Where did you go to school?	Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Eto Akta Gamat!	I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?	What's wrong with you?
Roger.	Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
"And just this year, ""Brian's Sound Spectrum"". Your own company even. Big step."	I was ahead of my time.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.	Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?	You don't like cheats, do you.
This psycho can.	Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.	Kampai.
Are you comfortable here?	Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Cecelia is, well...you know	Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?	They're not gonna send you right back.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.	Over my dead body.
Really?	My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
In the casino.	Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
In due time.	But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
They hack into people's programs?	Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You don't have to say anything.	Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Help!	Help!
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.
Because he dated her.	How did you guess?
Yes, thank you, sir.	Bene! Bene!
I know...and I'm really sorry.	Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Why did you do it?	Why'd I do what?
I... I blacked out.	Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.	Do you have to be so damn forthright?
You're right.	There you go.  Love you.
Have I?	I'm Lucy.
Did you cry when your father died?	Yeah.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.	Go on.  Good so far.
It's okay.  Forget it.	But I would like to buy you drink.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.	Oh, I would love that, Wally.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.	Do you think the police did a good job?
That's never been proven	Neither has his heterosexuality.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?	Surely you can't be serious.
No.	It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?	I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.	No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?	Max.
Mmm, what?	Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid	She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.	I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Wally thinks apples are boring.	I never said they were boring.
Yes, I thought so.	Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Hey.	Do you swear you didn't know?
There's only four of them...	Move you fools!
Yes.	She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"	I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
But...	What?
Burma!	Oh...
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.	All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Walk over to the window ...	Let it be rain, please let it be --
I'm taking you home. You're not well.	No, no. I have to get back. I have -
What'd he say?	Who cares?
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.	Thank you.
Barely.	You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
How did I look?	Happy. Happy with a secret.
Why?!	She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
All ready?	As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.	Who were the victims?
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.	We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You are female?	As you see.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --	What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
We don't know that.	Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.	Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Where's Ich?	Unavailable.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --	-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
What'd he say?	Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
"""Fifteen minutes of fame?"" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either."	Smashing!
Yes, Sister?	Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Options.	Wait or act.
Amy.	Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.	Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.	You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.	Then take it from him.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.	She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--	Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Oh.	Hi.
They say you're in debt.	Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.	You don't love ME.
We'll take care of it.	And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.	What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
You did okay, Bishop.	Well, thanks, I --
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.	How so?
I think so.	That's my girl.
Yes.	"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!	Hudson, give us a break.
Thank you, Exposition.	Oh, and Austin...
Yes.	You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.	What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
I didn't count the days.	Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Nobody told me anything.	What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Shut up!	She knows it was our fault!
I'll tell you later.	It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.	Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.	Aye-firmative.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.	Is that a good sign, Doctor?
I don't know.	What's this?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?	"The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled ""Indians"" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that ""Indians"" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906."
Who is this... ?	Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?	No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.	Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
Eight?	Pick me up?
Yeah?	Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Cool, bro, now listen up...	...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.	I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.	It's nice.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.	It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
That's your domain.	OK.
What are you bitching about now?	What are you doing here?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?	Island.  Far.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
But Sacha always puts out that light --	-- Tonight he forgot.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.	In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Why'd you do that?	I don't want to hear it.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?	Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.	No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Engine 115, right?	How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.	This was in fourth grade.
You're gonna help us take him.	No chance.
Amber? Here.	"""Here,"" wh-wh-what?"
Oh no, my friend...	Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.	Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
You know you can come under the blanket.	It's alright.
Where the hell is he?	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
What the fuck for?	For holes.
Can we dream?	Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
I thought I was here to meet women.	Not that one!
What's the running time?	Thirty-four seconds!
You'll take care of that.	Give me a break, would you?
He's right on the heading.	All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
I need to uh...	Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?	Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.	One last push. One.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.	Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.	A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Can you believe how perfect it fits?	Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.	yeah?
Anyone particular in mind?	You.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?	I lost my job...
So you can't tell me anything?	It's going to be a long winter.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.	Thank you, Sire!
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.	Look, thank you for this but--
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!	What happened?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.	Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
In here, says he wants a million.	Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
How?	Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.	I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
I want someone I know to take me in.	Who?
We have matching luggage.	What?
How long have you worked for the agency?	Me? Four years.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.	Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Looks like it stung him.	Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Well, not really, I --	You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
I know it, man. Hang on.	Jesus Christ.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.	No.
Carnes? Wait.	Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.	Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
I slept too near where I fell out.	You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.	How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Can't he come out for one day?	We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.	That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.	Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
You	Have we met?
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.	Oh, would you...?
"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."	Yes!
We drinkin' buddies now?	To freedom.
6... 5...	Found it?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.	I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
That's not really a very proper question.	How old are you?
Maybe I did... I don't remember.	I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
No.	Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Who's this fuck?	He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.	Hey, when in Rome --
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.	Come with me. And stay in the room.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.	So? Be real easy.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.	This is hardly the time or the place.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.	You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Beware the moon?	Come on, I'm freezing.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!	I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Yes.	I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?	Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
We bought you.	That was me.
Is he... dying then?	Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.	Where's Matt?
Then you yield to me.	On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
What are you sorry for?	I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.	Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
You gonna sing me somethin'?	When? Now? Oh. No.
Ready?	Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.	Do you have to swear all the time?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.	Maybe I did... I don't remember.
"I felt guilty. 'Cause I ""owed so much"" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --"	Gary.
Which one, right or left?	The brown one.
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.	No way.
How are you fixed?	I'm okay, Matt.
And do they believe it?	Is it true?
Know her?	We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Nick...	If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.	That's right.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?	Oh yes.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.	I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.	...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
How'd you get this?	I stole them.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.	Charlie...
Set!	Now!
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.	A hunting accident is perfect.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.	Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...	"""Most smartest?"" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. ""Most smartest."" We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home."
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.	Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.	Same thing, isn't it?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!	There's no call for that kind of language.
Is Dunbar cute?	That is the most unprofessional --
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!	I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
What?!	David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Go ahead.	Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Cameron.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.	What?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!	Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.	You mean soap?
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.	Huh?
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
You heard the news.	I hear Twombley got shot.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.	Yes, sir.
There they are!	Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Where are you bound for?	That is none of your business.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!	I do not confess.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.	This is only a vaudeville.
What?	The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Yes, well...	So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
What happened to your neck?	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
They want your autograph.	Who am I supposed to be?
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!	That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Have you no fear of God?	That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.	And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Any chance we can do that again?	Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.	Marg! You got orders!
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?	Yeah.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.	And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.	She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Mr. Thomerson, I...	Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --	-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Nine bodies.	Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Kat! Wake up!	What?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?	Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Bye, Troy!	Bye, Adam!
That is...if you're not doing anything.	Oh no. I have no plans.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...	There are reasons for the way we do things here.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.	Who would do such a thing?
Rose... please...	Laz... You can't say nothin'...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.	Not at all, John.
-- where's left to go? --	-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.	A Russian?
What's his problem?	That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.	Bye.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?	You may.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.	Sounds good, pops.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.	...Why?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.	I guess you have to get back home soon?
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.	Very well.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?	The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.	YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
You disappointed in me?	No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...	Well, we have to help her!
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...	So hello.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.	I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*	You and Verona?
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!
Yeah?	Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.	Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.	Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --	I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I'm going now, Cole.	I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.	What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
No, he's very upset about something.	Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...	It was different...
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?	I don't think so.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?	They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I'm sorry, Bob.	That's OK.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.	The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Absolutely.	It's his life insurance money, you know.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...	I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
Listen, what are you doing tonight?	What? Oh, I'm...busy.
But Chief?  Over this??	There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
When'd he tell you?	This morning.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --	Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.	Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Who are you revolting against?	We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
How'd you get her out of town?	Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.	Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
You know you're welcome any time!	Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.	To life.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.	What's normal?
Chart says he's from New York.	I think he's a Jew.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.	Where?
What do you mean, help?	I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...	Oh...
Whose fault was that?	I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
So what?	When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Let's go get him!	He's too well-protected right now.
You look great.	Thanks for calling.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.	Agreed.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?	Yeah.
About him?	No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.	I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
So what was all this -- some sort of test?	Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.	It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
How long have I been here?	You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.	Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
He didn't leave with them.	Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I came with Captain Renault.	I should have known.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.	You have a helluva way of answering.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...	In my house, you watch that lip...
Trychticholorate.	Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.	Really? Because --
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.	Child pornography.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.	You're sure?
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.	De-la-croix.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.	Oh?
What money?	Don't bullshit me.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?	I don't know.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?	I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?	It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Yeah.	Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?	Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
You know the answer to that.	Can't he come out for one day?
Where?	Never mind.
He wants you to come and see him.	He said that?
Really?	Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Do you want the car?	No, I'm just gonna walk around.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.	I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Who do you think, Chief?!	Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?	Are you for real?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.	You sayin' you'll do what?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...	Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.	I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I can't...I can't find a shelter	You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.	Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Get rid of it.	Why?
Can't it wait?	No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --	I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I...	"""I have these uh..."" She explains to you... ""When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses."" Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds."
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?	I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?	Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Sorry...PD only.	It's okay.
Then do it, asshole.	Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...	Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
David says Jack comes to warn him.	Warn him?
The Lifeline is divided that way.	Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
How do you get your hair to look like that?	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Let's talk about Conklin.	What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
Yeah?	Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
When did she die?	Is...? She's dead then?
What about the FBI?	They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Come into the study a minute.	Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes.	They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.	My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Squid?	Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?	And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.	We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
What?	That's not the information I've received.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.	Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.	I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.	Is that what you call it?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!	What's the problem here?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.	What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.	No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
You're sure right. It is a strange world.	Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
That's Paul Owen.	That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
The other guy.	Where... how'd you hear that?
"Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say ""May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm."" And you will say..."	Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.	Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Did I ever tell you about how...	Yes.
What?	No one else knows
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...	Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?	I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Yes.	Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?	Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?	I have no idea.
Four months.	Four months?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.	Right!
He's the devil's child...	We'll all go crazy...
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.	That's the way I see it, too.
The children! May I see?	Of course.
Her name is Gretchen.	That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Oh! What is it?	"""Proud... to be... an... American."""
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.	This is natural.
That seems very unlikely.	Yes, I thought so.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.	So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
You are a fine figure of a man.	Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?	Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
What happened?	He fell.  He falls.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.	No.
Daddy. Daddy, please...	Jim... for godsake!
What else do you think about during school?	"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.	I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.	Dorothy. No!
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...	Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.	Okay honey.
Why not?	Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-	I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Yeah.	Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
-- I work for the city.	You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Whoever that is.	So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.	This isn't homicide school.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.	You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.	They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?	You betrayed us.
And then?	And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?	Great.
Then he didn't send you?	No, sir. This is my own idea.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.	Come to my office, Miss Price.
The best.	I love that car.
Yeah, lots.	See. Get your boots.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.	He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Uh, yes, you do.	Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Let's get the fuck out of here!	Not that tunnel, the other one!
What are you listening to?	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
On what you pay me?	Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?	No, not yet.
You did?	You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Whooee!	As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
And what did she die of, exactly?	She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You're a very beautiful girl.	I thought you were asleep.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...	Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Yeah, I see her.	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!	You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I don't know about that.	Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.	Ugh.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.	But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Are you okay?	Yeah.
The milkmaid's daughter?	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!	Austin, I have something for you as well.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...	Yes, father?! Yes?
I'm trying.	This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.	Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.	That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.	Yeah.
You seem to know all about my destiny.	I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!	I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.	Same thing Giuliani said.
You can shut up now.	You are a charmer.
Half a million.	Jesus.
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.	Yes, sir.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.	Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --	You can't threaten me --
All Vienna has heard that.	And do they believe it?
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.	Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
The key, goddamit, the key!	Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?	Huh?
So did my father and his father before him.	But it's a responsibility...
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!	This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Did you?	These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Ted, the lever!	Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
This is the best score yet.	It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.	No need to be modest, Brian.
Animals?	I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?	Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
What about?	We'll discuss that in the board room.
Why didn't you go?	Too old.
You want to tell me about it?	"OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the ""yellow man"". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."
My insurance does not cover PMS	Then tell them I had a seizure.
Hey, how'd my car get here?	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.	I know.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.	Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!	If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.	You're pissed we didn't get credit?
-- Yes?	When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?	Yes.
You were talking in your sleep.	Not talking. Writing.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?	Just let me sit down.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I deserve a lot worse.	What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.	Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?	Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Where are you going?	I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.	How long until it blows?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?	Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.	Are you quite finished with us?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.	Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Why?	He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
But you don't want to hear it.	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.	Yeah.
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
Aye.	On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
These are originals?	Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What's it all about?	What?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.	She's a programmer?
You don't understand me.	You don't understand you either.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.	Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Then you saw him, too?	Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Where am I?	You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.	Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
You know how your Daddy is.	If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I lost my job...	Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.	Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Oh he forced you, huh?	He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.	You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Where's the other stocker?	There's another stocker, right?
Do you want to tell me what you found?	Cash, stock certificates, and this...
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.	He's just playing big brother.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?	I got overhead...
But you're sure?	He was at the campground yesterday.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!	Phoenix?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.	Did you see Jack?
It is intuitively obvious.	Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Yes, Mr. President.	Why?
I'm working on it.	I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.	Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
What'd the girl say?	There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Dude Finlay?	Yes, sir.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.	Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
You a preacher?	That's right.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.	You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Alive?	Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
I don't know. Panties and --	Your dried cum.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?	"Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, ""Pageants are old-fashioned"" and, uh, and ""demeaning"" to the girls --"
No.	Did you tell him you did?
Not like that.	Then what?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.	But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.	I know that. But you can now.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?	Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.	I can't believe this.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.	And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.	The result would be ...
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.	I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally	I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Mother Mary, full of grace.	What did you do, Connor?
Mmm.	You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?	Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...	I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
Don't speak Russian!	Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.	Curly.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?	You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.	Let's get him in here.
Yeah.	She's not with you?
Bob's upset.	The posters?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.	No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.	So you say ...
We did talk about Naomi.	I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.	Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?	Yeah, a man's drink...
What's wrong with your hand?	Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.	Let me think about it.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?	The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.	Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
How you holding up, Wade?	I'm fine, fine.
You're crazy.	I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
You okay?	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Where's the manager?	Where's the other stocker?
Wanna stay with me tonight?	I wanna have supper waitin'.
There was no visible wound?	No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
Eve?!	Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...	Are we going to argue?
Wha... ?	Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Well, that's great.	Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
What is your name?	Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
"""Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards""?"	Coffee sucked.
You know French?	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
No. He did not.	Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.	It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.	Give me 365.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.	He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Corn-i-Lius?	At your service.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.	Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Where?!	Stop!
Mantan, we got a show to tape.	My name is Manray, goddamnit.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.	Check.
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Shut up.	It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.	This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
He's a boy dog.	Yeah.
And Outpost? You're happy there?	Yes sir.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?	Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
Hey, honey.	Hey.
Ask them what the candles are for.	You ask them.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.	Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
At what altitude?	I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.	Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.	'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
What do you mean, Sire?	Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Do you love me?	I asked first.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?	I dazzled him with my wit
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.	You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.	The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Of course! I would've heard.	How?
Yes!	I love you! I love you!
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.	I was well compensated.
That water's freezing!	He's from Alaska.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?	No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
Friend of yours?	Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Bad habit.	I know. I'm sorry.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.	Okay.
Roc. You okay?	Yeah. Anybody call for me?
GOOD MORNING!	Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
*Liver* killed him?	*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
That's a good one.	Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...	Hey...hey...it's okay!
How would you describe him?	Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.	Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
If I could go back to farming --	That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?	In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.	That's not bad for any day.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.	Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?	What?
Yes.	But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
I might still have a few chips left.	*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Not particularly.	"Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or ""nori"" if you prefer. I love sushi."
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!	Where is he now?
What's this?	"""I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?"
Come over after I'm done here?	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Absolutely.	Why'd you want to help us?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!	See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
You 'um big lawman?	Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.	I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
How can I go?	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?	I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Are you sure you even packed it?	My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.	No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Karl.	Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Freeze!	Nobody move!
Maybe he'll get back to work.	Speaking of which...
Mr. Henry?	Come on in!
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.	You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
It was... It was...	Male or female, bitch?!!
You don't know... nobody knows...	I might.
Rest, William.	I rest.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.	Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.	No, the Dan part was nice...
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.	Do you get to meet Ed?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.	Then... I guess you have to.
What?	When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.	Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
What is it, Hal?	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.	You do that.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.	I love you Jack, you know that.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...	And what do you think Mendez?
Your phone number?	In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.	Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?	You go to hell.
Excuse me?	Donnie? You're a dick.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.	She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!	You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.	I gotta work with these women.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?	Put it down as a gesture to love.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.	So he fooled you.
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -	<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!	No. I was calm.
Her belongings?	That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
You know anyone's who's taken it?	That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.	Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
Hi.	Hi.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.	"Hey Skippy? Do I have the word ""chump"" tattooed on my forehead?"
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.	Whaddya mean, buy?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.	He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
I have an appointment.	No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Yeah, him.	What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.	I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Ahh, sunshine.	You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Secret ...	... love...
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.	I'll help you out.
So what's going on, Joel?	I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
You okay?	Yeah.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.	Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.	David, stop!
Who?	A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?	Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Lots of people...	Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Chief knows.	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.	I am. I am, sir.
Cool!	Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.	I'll be there.
Have fun tonight?	Tons
I speak English.	Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.	...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Oh no.	No.  Hi baby.
We never really shared one.	You're inhuman.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.	Rudy Levine the shmuck?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.	But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.	Alex?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.	For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
I don't want to move again... I like it here.	Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Guilty until proven innocent?	Mother and Father know best.
I thought you got rid of...	...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
But you looked as if you liked it.	"I *did* like it. All I said was, ""It's not 'King Kong'."""
It's more like a date.	It's a long way to go for a date.
I don't think we're ready.	You're not ready.
So Dorsey can get the girl?	Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
Evan Treborn.	The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
The hell are you talkin' about?	Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
Weren't we supposed to?	Oh... I feel a little... oh...
My best friend. My very best friend.	Shall I read to you?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Where's Ronnie?	Well I don't...
I can't give you a lift back tonight.	Don't worry.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.	Screw that.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.	So now you hate all women?
What is your problem?	My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.	Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'	Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?	He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
You got a problem with drilling, probie?	No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?	Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Okay.	I've left those pills for you.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.	The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
How long has my father been like this?	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Where was Marcus?	He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --	You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
In Cluett's office?	Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
You'd be surprised how often they are.	Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?	I didn't count the days.
How the hell do you know that?	A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
A dubious distinction, no?	I guess it depends on your perspective.
You defend yourself admirably...	... for a commoner?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.	"So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says ""The code's fine, the program's for shit"" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!"
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.	I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .	Well . . .
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.	Oh, I'm sure it will!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.	Amen.
Snap out of it, bomb.	In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
What the hell are you doing?	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Ouch.	I'm sorry.
How's that football story corning along?	You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
Are you still here?	Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.	And he doesn't care about me?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.	You are a hell of a woman.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?	Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?	I want to know what happened.
That.	Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Fifty minutes.	Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.	How much longer is this gonna last?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.	Really?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.	Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Straight up.	Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Apipoulai!	"I suppose that means ""Hi"" ?"
With these?	Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.	I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.	But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
That's not playing by the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
I was hoping you could tell me.	You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Why not?	One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I don't trust anyone.	Then show me how.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!	Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Believed what?	I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.	You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.	Says you were a bully...
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.	What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
She's alive!! She is not dead?	Laugh it up.
Oh yeah?	Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.	Wah...?  Where are...?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.	Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Whoa... she just farted.	I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Oh Jesus.	If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?	Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Hey!	"""Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."""
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...	You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?	Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Really?	My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.	So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Just a tip.	What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.	Yeah.
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...	It's not my business any more!
What time are visiting hours?	I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.	You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Hurry the fuck up!	This is some crazy shit, man!
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?	That is so gentlemanly of you.
Yeah, if it opens the door.	Yeah.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.	Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --	You didn't tell her?
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?	"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.	I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.	I do not seek forgiveness.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?	Ilene, Rick promised...
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.	And now you must let me be the judge of that!
You don't love ME.	No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I have faced that problem before.	But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Behold!	Behold!
Wallace's followers.	Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
What's this?	An attempted slit.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?	Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.	That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.	And I with you. But you must wake.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.	Don't make it less true.
I warned you, Dignan.	You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.	I was just about to have my dinner.
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?	Uh-uh.
Does that make you horny?	Not now, Austin.
Yes, I'll bet.	He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Hello?	You little sleaze bag!
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?	Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?	That's your problem.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!	I have ordered conscriptions...
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.	The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.	Firefly must be captured at any cost.
Do you love her?	I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Yes.	September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Um... that's very relaxing.	Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Why?	Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
What exactly do you mean?	The message you left.
What happened to them?	The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Peace of mind.	That's it?
Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.
Frau Mozart?	That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How big is it?	Oh, I'd say about --
But if someone miniaturized the process...	That's what we were working on.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.	Yah-sure, fine... fine.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.	Fair enough.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.	Look, I don't know what this...
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.	You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.	You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I don't understand.	Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
I do.	I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?	What?
She said yes.	Thank God...
What's going on down there?	He's not ready yet.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.	Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
You're not ready.	Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
Dignan, calm down.	You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Kamal is not here.	Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Homey.	See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.	Poor bastard.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?	Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?	Does this conversation have a purpose?
I have the letters right here.	Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
She took off in the night!	She took off on the bicycle, man.
We're stuck tight!	Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?	The... The funny man.
Of course.	Same thing.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.	Let's eat.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...	All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after	I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't	Get out, get out!
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!	Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
You look awful.	Thank you.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.	That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
...Okay.	It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?	So what was all this -- some sort of test?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?	No, Victor, there isn't.
Do we know what this says?	Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.	GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!	It's all very normal.
Oh.  We are Russian.	Yes. I know.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?	I can't imagine any place better than here.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.	Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
I never knew.	Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
How ya doin'?	Can't complain.
Yes?	Be careful.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.	There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.	Dad!
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?	I'm doing okay.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.	You have any children?
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.	In a second.
Appointment to what?	Viceroy of the West Indies.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.	Ma.
Uh... two shooters!	Fan-fuckin-tastic!
That'll be a test, won't it?	Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.	What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.	There were six of us...
A ring.  I wanted a ring.	You did?
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.	The sets were good.
"""The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."""	Very cool. Trippy.
To get some frozen poultry.	Then what?
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
But if they <u>do</u>?	I don't know.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?	No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
And I suppose you're the knight.	The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.	No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
What are you, high?	Yeah.
Makes two of us.	Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I do not confess.	Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Please.	Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
It's bad.	Worse than Warsaw.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.	Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Where are they!	Maybe --
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?	Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
That girl, she works at the casino --	-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.	Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.	Those really weird, short lines.
You wouldn't have done that?	Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.	What the fuck do you mean?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.	Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?	You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Escorts!	Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
What have you done?	I ain't done --
What did they say about Granada before today?	That she was impregnable.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.	She's right.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.	Nice neighborhood.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.	It's your fantasy...
I'm serious.	Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.	Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Thank you very much.	Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Where are you?	Jean-I'm not-
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...	Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Who?	Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.	You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?	Barely.
What about...	What about what?
It's easy to learn.	A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
What?	Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!	What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Don't bother.	I'll be right back.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.	While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!	Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Yes.	So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --	Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!	Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...	I don't know what to say
I said play!	Michael!
"That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."	I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?	Uh-huh.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.	You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.	Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...	Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.	You've got to let me go!
It's a long way to go for a date.	Tell me about it.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.	In time.
Did you wanna be alone?	No. Please.
Hey, look at you.	I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.	I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
One or two?	Two, please.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.	Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
How awful for John.	And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?	Four months.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.	Sounds risky to me.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!	He should be king!
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.	Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.	Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.	What was it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.	Because he'd shot Mueller.
I'm sure it's lovely.	But you don't want to hear it.
Saw what?	When dad died, I saw another fire...
What's that?	Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
How long are you planning to stay?	Two weeks.
I see.	Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.	Beware the moon?
So?	In the sight of God that is a sin.
Why? What has happened?	You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.	Nothing.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.	The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Help!	You'll drown us bo...
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.	Such as?
And?	I've questioned him.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?	You do me too much honour, Sire.
What about that Rock Island bastard?	It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.	Right!
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --	Six kilometers.  Four miles.
"You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."	Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
What?	They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.	I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?	Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Sure.	I didn't know that.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.	Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.	Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Mommy's here.	Baby wants to fuck.
Yeah?	I want to pick up my car.
How can you watch this crap?	Where are you going?
You lying son of a bitch...	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.	What's a nanny do?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!	You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Yes.	I believe you have a message for him?
He's going to be a fireman.	Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.	Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.	Hello, darling.
I should have known.	My husband is with me, too.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!	Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?	We don't know. West is dead.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.	Invade?! That's impossible, it --
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?	No.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.	Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
What?	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.	...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
See, Frank's being smart about this.	Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.	Fuck you!
He's on the telephone.	Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Sure.	Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.	I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...	It couldn't have been earlier?
Lunatic?	Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
I never knew that music like that was possible.	You flatter me.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.	It's not a plan. It's just --
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.	Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.	Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?	How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!	Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
What just happened?	Your daughters went to the prom.
...would you like a drink?	No thank you.
I beg your pardon?	I said, ask your wife.
Is he chasing us?	I don't know.
How did you get in here? You're under age.	I came with Captain Renault.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.	I figured.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?	No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I'll call you.	Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?	It's just something I had.  You know
He drinks.	He's got a reason.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.	Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?	Yes I did.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.	Opening pod bay doors.
I know.	Where's the rest?
How's the chicken?	Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !	- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
What's the *medical* explanation?	"Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about ""King Kong""?! Is that medically possible?"
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.	Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.	*Liver* killed him?
I don't want him.	Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.	Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.	I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.	Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?	Not if I find the right girl.
Congratulations. You passed the test.	What do you mean?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.	They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.	Silicon Valley?
What did you say? What did you do?	Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.	Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
My pleasure.	Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Knight ...	Black...
Great!	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!	All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.	I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.	Tavis, thank you for having me.
You mean until you showed up?	You're not still pissed?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.	Confidence. It's just confidence.
I think he saved my life.	How so?
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?	Everything will be seen to.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?	Milo! What about --?
This feels stupid.	Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...	He wants the money from your bank.
I emptied it.	Felt a little light.
Oh, shit...	Careful...
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?	We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Switch! You drive!	-- where? -
Don't turn around.	What?
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.	No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
That's too bad.	What do you know about the ear? Anything?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.	Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?	Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
I think we should try sneaking in.	Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Credit?	Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?	They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.	So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!	How 'bout this one?
Don't try to change to the subject.	Why don't you answer?
Which one pulled the trigger?	The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
I can't swim! I can't swim!	Relax!
Who killed Pike?	Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Ah, won't you sit down?	Thank you. Cream?
What will happen to him, Ted?	The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.	Good call.
Fifteen meters.	I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...	I thought everything was working out fine.
Why?	Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
No, it isn't that.	I want to know you.
When?	"""I saw you waiting there, by the gate."""
They're mutated sea bass.	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.	know, but
Really.	They said.
What about the zoo?	Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?	I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Where will you find such a girl?	Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
No class...	Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You'll call me, right?	Yeah.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.	Gaiijin?
Okay, I follow you so far...	Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.	Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Max.	Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Why not?	Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Now, wait a second --	You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.	I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Where's ganz?	In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Stop it.	Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Where's the goddamn car?	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.	What did you want for Christmas that year?
"""Too neat."" How long have you been an investigator?"	I don't think that has anything to do with --
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.
Roll the hose.	What, are you kidding? By myself?
She hates dem.	Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.	Not here.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.	It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Romance!	That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Let go of me...	GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?	He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...	The Age of Ragnarok ends...
When was the last time you cleaned this place?	Hmmm?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.	Your doctor?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I just wanted some make-up.	All that shit's on aisle 5.
Do what?	Vanish into thin air?
Yeah. A few things.	Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
"Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  ""CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."""	But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
What for?	Some service deserves service in return. No?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.	You did? A human ear?
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.	I met Dr. Kent, once.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!	Let's go NIGGERS.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Nah, I musta missed it.	Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.	"Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.	Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
You didn't answer my question.	Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
Give me the film.	Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
She's not with you?	Who.
In the house?	No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.	How?
I'm going to take a look at this.	Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?	It feels wonderful.
We're in the middle of a murder case --	Best time for banal chit-chat.
Where?	The creek bed --
Describe him.	Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Yes sir.	What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.	You're drunk --
What's the point?	Not to be trapped.
Where ya goin?	Away.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.	Really, Loretta?
Thirty -five years!	Then after that it's safe.
Quite impressive.	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Loop around real fast.	Just turn right here.
Chief says -- how many?	Thousands.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.	Well, I never heard that one.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.	Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Good morning.	Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?	Yes, I would.
There's one more thing, Austin.	Yes?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.	No, I'm lost.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?	He only weighs ten ounces --
Then you think it might have worked out?	Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.	Leave him!
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.	How well do you remember the lab?
This is some crazy shit, man!	Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.	Shut it up, Loretta.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.	Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.	More like deployed in bed asleep.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?	What is it?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?	He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Six, huh?	Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
People get hurt.	But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.	Exactly. A dance.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?	Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Feeling better now?	Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Leave me alone, Marion.	You're already alone.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...	Yeah?
Where can I meet this man?	Immediately.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...	Yeah.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.	We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.	What are you saying?
Yeah.	I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.	That's okay.
That's okay. I --	I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.	There you are!
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?	All right, then...
Larry, you and your wife got problems?	I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
John Merrick.	John... Merrick
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?	Yeah.  I got it.
And some new clothes.	Why?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!	Key?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.	They don't?
Have sex. Y'know --	Oh, um...
This is everything? Is there.	Is there. Is all there.
I've seen a few.	Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.	Excellency, you are right.
What do you mean?	The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.	Fartsbishop!
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?	What are you talking about?
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?	It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Go on! Get out!	Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.	I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?	No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
I want to show you something.	You have to do something for me first.
No, I don't get that!	You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.	Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Jesus!  Don't do that!	Sorry, babe.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.	No class...
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.	So?
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.	We'll come up with the next big thing.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.	Well
What?	She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Never mind that, I want my man!	He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
I don't know... I just feel scared.	About what?
You're selling dad's boat?	Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
David! You're hurting my feelings.	Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.	The bet's off.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.	I might say the same.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...	I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.	I'll see you in my dreams.
No, sir. This is my own idea.	I see.
Uh, Gladys?	What!
You could've handwritten it.	I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Where have you been, Jay?	Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.	Rae don't do this now...
Jack Manfred.	Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.	Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.	But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
I can't even keep fish alive.	A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
Well?	Sublime! Utterly sublime!
How'd you do it?	Do what?
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.	Nevertheless --
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.	That's good.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.	There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.	I'll get a coat for her.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?	I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.	Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.	I don't want to.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.	Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.	Perfect, Cole.
Same thing, isn't it?	No, it is NOT.
I don't fuckin' cook.	Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
But it's a responsibility...	But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
And who might you be, sir?	Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
So he's won.	No.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.	You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
No bodies, no West...	No death certificates. No crime.
Oh you do, huh?	Just a little something' somethin'.
First pregnancy?	Yes, for both.
What do you want to do with it?	Give it back to him.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.	Charlie!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.	What is it?
Now stop it!	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Talk to the bomb.	I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
You're not venturing alone, surely.	I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Can't make enough axe-heads!	But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
What friend?	Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.	I remember that speech really well.
I hear Twombley got shot.	Yeah.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.	Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
"Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says ""Let's ride."""	He's not bad at it.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?	You're ruthless.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?	Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.	Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.	You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.	Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Hi.	How was it?
People actually used to pay you for this?	Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?	Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
"Well, your ""cheap whore"" is this family's ""lovin' mother.""  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and..."	-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.	We'll have to see when we get back.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.	No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
So I did! And what was so important about it?	Scotland. He intends --
What are we having?	It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
How long have you been married?	Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?	Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
Patrick? I can't hear you.	What are I doing?
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.	You did go through my stuff.
Um-hum.	I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
No.	When do you deliver your project?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.	*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
You're such a fuck-ass.	When did you stop taking your medication?
I told him that you all is sick.	Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
...Were you?	We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --	"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
Because you always obey orders ...	Always.  Except ...
I know what you did.	Who is this.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?	No.. I've slept enough.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.	That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Howard, they've disappeared again.	Oh dear.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?	Yes.
*What* view?	Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
The front stairs.	Where were you?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.	I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
I thought you were asleep.	I was. What are you reading?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
What does she want?	I don't know.
You look beautiful.	Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
No. I'm not.	How?
Money.	Jack doesn't need money.
She was unconscious, Patrick.	She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
To us it was.	But it's not funny now.
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?	It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...	I don't think this is a good time...
I was here!	...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
Then I shall come too.	No... no...
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?	No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.	What happened?
Flying the plane.	You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.	All right, dear.
I don't want to live anymore.	Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
You can see for yourself.	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!	Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.	I guess it isn't.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...	What's the matter with my place?
Do you have it?	Yes.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.	Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
He's smart.	Yes, dear, I know.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Yes.	How many?
No. I just have short hair.	Is that your chiquita?
You were talking about your wedding.	I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Thank you for calling the white House...	No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.	The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Give me your hand.	Oh, my God...
Thank God.	First time I ever heard that.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.	Who?
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.	That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
She tells you how I've been--	--a philandering pig.
You'll move	I will not.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.	NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?	No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?	She went back to South Africa.
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --	Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.	Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.	Frank?
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.	Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Don't, I'll drink it.	Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
What?	It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
How much did they get from the safe?	Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Manray was under our nose the whole time.	Do you know how you will use him?
I'm candy...	Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Russia.	When did we get it from them?
Do you like the way I feel?	Yes.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?	I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You're kidding.	No.
What here?	He's on the telephone.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.	And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
You keeping out of trouble?	I'm trying.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?	You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.	...Worse?
Your dead friend Jack?	Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.	Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...	And what are you like? A wino?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!	Dorothy Vallens?
Like you and Gordon?	Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Really.	And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Then what?	Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
Has the response picked up?	Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?	Yeah.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --	The fuck are you talking about --
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.	Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!	I know first aid!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -	Stanzi!
I thought it was you. It's the hair!	I'm working on that soccer story.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --	Buttfucks the cabin?
Yeah?	Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?	Yes.
Indeed.	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Well then, perhaps you also ---	-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.	Do you feel that way?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.	In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.	We'll take care of it.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.	And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.	Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Is he awake?	He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.	I'm awfully sorry.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.	Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.	There's no disease, I can tell you.
Just be natural, goddamit.	How long since your last confession, my son?
Hi, Rob and Carrie.	Go back to sleep.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.	Leaving what?
Did you see Jack?	No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Where do you go from here?	Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.	Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
I know.	Now what do you want to talk about?
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.	People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?	Gravity.
What are you doing?	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Why tell me this?	The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.	You were spoiled rotten.
Milo?	Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I haven't given you much of a life.	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.	Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?	I don't know.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.	The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...	The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
I know.	It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?	Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.	David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?	Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Anything else?	What are we going to do about this?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.	You can walk away.  We both can.
Can --	On me. For the seat. Cheers.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.	As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
It's not true.	Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.	Lily... Jesus Christ...
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...	No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.	I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?	Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
You're lying!	Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?	He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?	Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.	I didn't know.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...	This?
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?	Sure.  I'll call the guy.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.	Ah - you've heard that?
You're all clear.	Roger.
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.	Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Why is that?	We never would have had this conversation.
Sorry.	Looks like you know a song.
I'm going out for awhile.	Do you want the car?
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.	That he was.
No.  There's no way!	Hear me out...
Will it track back to us?	No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Maybe he just went to the store.	He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.	Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Never mind how I found you.	Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Donnie.	I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
Sven!	Let me do something for myself for a change!
You want me drunk?	I won't be that long.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.	Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.	Got a pencil?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?	Okay.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.	Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
Is there something wrong with the phone?	In the living room.
Let me have ten bucks?	Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
He's on duty.	I paid for that.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.	But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.	He didn't leave with them.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.	How'd you get the job?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.	Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.	Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.	Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
There's a million places to hide around here.	Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.	I see.
Where is he?	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Yes.	I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Is that why you're still here?	Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.	"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"
"... and so, and so the doctor says, ""If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?""  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?"	In the other man's rectum.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.	Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
It's stupid.	It's fun.
You're fucking dead!	I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.	We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.	Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?	May I be quite frank with you?
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?	I'm a working stiff, pops.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?	With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.	If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
You're weird.	I'm sorry.
Suppose we do.	My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.	That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
You'll do it?	Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.	Think of what?  We're fucked.
What business?	Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.	In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
I don't know what to say	You're killing me...
I want them arrested and hanged!	Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.	Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.	Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!	Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.	Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?	We haven't checked.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.	Other way around, sir.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?	Industrial refuse.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.	I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Gaiijin?	An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.	Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?	No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!	You did the same to your God!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?	No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?	OK.
Why did he come back for you?	I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.	Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.	Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!	He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.	Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.	Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Patrick?	What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Nobody's named this one yet.	It's my turn!
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.	See you tomorrow, maybe.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.	For all those vacation days you got coming.
I believed in you...	Give me absolution.
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?	That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
I'll tell you when we get there.	Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
Why doesn't that surprise me?	I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?	I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.	I think your dinner's burning.
Yes, but...	These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
I didn't.	Then you're not a pro.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.	Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It's in front of us.	Do you think it's a dog?
Four --	Get in.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.	What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah.  I promise.	Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.	Chulo, one thing at a time.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.	You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Why?	You have to start getting into your character.
C'est bon, Monsieur.	Merci!
You like to kiss her goodbye.	No thanks.
What do you want to hear?	You pick it.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?	I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?	I'm sorry. It is.
No problem. Look, I...	You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.	Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.	Why do you say that?
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.	Likewise.
You just haven't been looking.	Would you like to see my apartment?
Yes!	You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?	I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I don't know about that plantation angle.	What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
Biggest in two battalions.	We're gonna be okay, man...
Hello?	Speak to me Fucker.
What the fuck is going on?	Your weapons, Sergeant.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.	You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
That's it?	Yeah.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.	I'm not a stalker.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.	"Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."
John, how's your wife this morning?	Much better this morning, thank you.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.	I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Mr. Williams . . .	The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Gay.	Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?	You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?	It's... too slow.
I want a gun.	It is not allowed.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.	Hello, glad to meet you.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.	He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
You went berserk...	I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?	I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
What the fuck do you want from me?	I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Yes.	Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.	Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Twenty-five more'n I got.	All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Not now.	What is wrong with you?
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?	Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.	Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?	Yup.
Industrial refuse.	Garbage man?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?	I need Il Duce.
Mantan?	Mantan!!
For the last time, put them on the table.	If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
You tellin' the truth.	Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Where... where are my clothes?	Those are your clothes, silly.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Yeah.	Does Osborne agree?
"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."	The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Finland.	You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Specialty product.	You're learning.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!	Stevie... I...
Will Bogey get bent?	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.	I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Sorry, love.	I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?	Yes.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?	Where are you going?
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.	They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.	I don't have to.
How you doing, man?	Not bad, not bad.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?	I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Bill Styles...	Who?
You're drunk --	I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Meaning?	I'm out.
"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you."	It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.	Thank you very much. Good day.
Could be Leon's.	Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.	Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You okay?	Yeah, I guess so.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?	"When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections ""underdeveloped."" Would you?"
Then you can't come in.	I have an appointment.
Charming Schuvaloff.	Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?	I didn't, baby, you just told me.
What?	Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...	Bullshit.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.	How on earth can you tell?
This could be a trap.	Come on, Dignan.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?	Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Is that written in his shoe?	Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.	Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Up there!!	I don't see anything!
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.	That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.	You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?	Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.	You said you could help.
I don't know --	Where are they!
Gary, I --	You see what's hanging on the wall?
Why not?	Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
"No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?"" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me."	Is it a what?
Hi, Eve!	Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?	Dr. Hirsch?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...	That's the only reason you're alive...
What?	"What Kendall said -- ""the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around."" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter."
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.	Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
In every sense. If at all possible.	You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.	When?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -	Half watch dog?
I been waiting a long time for some money.	How much?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.	Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Divorced.	Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Ho, diplomatist!	How about New York?
It's just a nightmare.	I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
Tennessee?	I'll explain on the way.
Mom, what're we...?	Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
What?	I know what you did.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.	What else can we do?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?	Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
Any clue as to what it is?	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...	Too many cooks --
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?	Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Aren't you forgetting about something?	You are, and it's behind you.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.	Hi.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?	Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Good morning.	Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.	If that's the way you want it.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.	That could be anybody's.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.	Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.	It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
I met this girl.	What? Come on. Is it serious?
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.	Every little boy's fantasy.
You can't cheat an honest man.	You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Is your niece older than 12?	Oh, she older than that.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.	"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I'm sorry I woke you up.	Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I'm glad you do.	There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.	They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.	Yes, sir.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.	Do you have bad dreams, too?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!	Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
It's always the women that start the trouble.	She got me thinking...
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!	Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.	Where?
My condolences.	His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
You got a light, honey?	What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
It can buy you a new and better you.	"I just don't know if this says, ""me"". What's the fabric?"
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!	All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
How many colonists?	Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?	This is it.
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.	Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I can.	So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.	Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
I'm really sorry about that, man.	Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.	You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...	I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.	Ha! Where's that?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?	He must be replaced.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.	I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.	The name of the show?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?	Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Yes on all counts.	I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
I'm sorry honey, but...	Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Investigator Rimgale.	I need to get in the trunk.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.	Aye.
She had a moustache.	She was European!
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?	You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.	I don't know nothing about it.
You called me Jeffrey.	I did. Are you?
Remember the Alamo?	I beg your pardon?
Is that right?	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?	Shoot.
Don? Are you in with them?	No. But you're in very big trouble.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I'm leaving, too.	But, Eve, I would--
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --	Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.	I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.	Good day, Mr. Merrick.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.	Yes ma'am.
We're police officers.	You're foreigners.
Yes, but.	Then, shut up!
"""During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium""."	Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?	Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Ye-es, Je-an?	Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
What's his name?	OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
What is it, now?  Tell me...	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.	Kept us warm for twelve years.
You stuff sausage in it.	And what do you do with the bones?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.	When will his trial be?
Wow. Should you tell my father?	I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?	Never mind that, I want my man!
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?	I slept very well.
This is the end of the chase.	Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
You don't miss it?	I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?	She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.	I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.	Why the hell not?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.	And why would I do that?
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!	Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?	Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.	Who's that, Ted?
Hello?	Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.	Why's his britches round his knees?
You think so?	You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.	What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.	You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.	I love you.
Behold!	Behold!
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.	-- C'mon, Stephen.
No!  Nothing happened.	Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?	I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
It's bait.  Don't take it.	Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.	Well you did.
Sometimes neither.	Some... What does that mean?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!	Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!	You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
What are you doing?	Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Do I make you nervous?	Yeah.
Yes?	I need to uh...
Who? Applejack?	Why did he go that way?
-- What were they doing there?	They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.	That's just a dream, William!
Just perfect.	A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.	Send them in.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.	Gee... What makes you say that?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?	Jeffrey nothing.
I thought you weren't dying.	I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
What word would you use, Elaine?	The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.	Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Huh.	So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Quantum is up thirty-five.	I read the same here.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.	Aw, c'mon.
It's my wife.	I thought you were divorced.
A grand.	Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.	Who wants to be first?
"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."	Yes! That's right!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.	Shut up, you zombie!
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...	Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
One shot -- for emergencies.	That's not playing by the rules.
Okay, how do you want to do it?	I want someone I know to take me in.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?	Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...	Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
I like to read.	Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.	But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.	What for?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?	Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
No, it's different, honey.	Did you ever have a baby?
Who?	William - he asked me to meet him here.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	Answer the question, Patrick
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.	"You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: ""It never rain every day."" This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!"
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.	I like my horizons narrow.
Not entirely.	How's that football story corning along?
You made that move, huh?	While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Falling.	No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Eleven fifteen.	OK. Mark that down.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.	Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Are you coming to my party?	No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.	You wish.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!	Did I miss something?
"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."	What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Richard, I had to see you.	"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."
Okay.  You ready?	Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
You stayed away?	Yeah.
I feel the ribbon.	Then you must get it.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.	Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.	Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
Mark, are you okay?	Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?	Ask the chef.
Hello, baby.	Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
What does Starsky say?	He says. This is he.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...	How you let men treat ya like they do?
I don't know! I just said that!	Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Why would I be pissed?	It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
"The Chinese have a proverb: ""That which appears too good to be true, usually is."" There's gotta be a catch."	"Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, ""Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole."" We're going this time and that's all there is to it."
Is it the one you wanted?	Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
I've left those pills for you.	A doper werewolf.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.	No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
No-I can't take the time off work.	Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Don't threaten me, Bob.	Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Huh?	It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.	Fuck you.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.	The other ones?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?	Your mother?
Cool.	I'm really sorry about that, man.
Keep looking.	What're we looking for?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.	Like you could find one
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...	Yes, John?
What do you want me to say?	Just don't lie to me.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.	Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Surely there must be something you can do.	I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
It's what I do. It's my job.	Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I thought you didn't.	I'm playing to win.
She was gonna get away.	Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.	I understand.
Which one is that?  Raw what?	This is mole.  It's good.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.	We rented a car.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.	You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?	I don't think so.
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --	Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.	When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
No, I understand.	He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...	They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.	Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
That's where we came out.	It's a lot of money, Pam.
You don't know him.	I know you.
Oops!	All right, who serves?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.	I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?	'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?	That would be appropriate, yes.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.	There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?	No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.	You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
What I think is going on with your son.	Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.	Save it for Bourne.
Said what?	About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Then you got undressed.	How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
You sure you want me to?	Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Dad lives here?	Not in this wing, actually. No.
What're they building?	#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Chuck.	What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
You were saying?	Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Want another?	We drinkin' buddies now?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.	Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.	I know what you've been doing.
Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.	I'll bet you can.  Sit.
There's a casino in this hotel.	I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
David?	I doubt it. But it's something to do.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.	There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...	Tell me about it...
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.	Hey, Mick!
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.	I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
How do you do, ma'am.	I do alright.
What are watchin' this junk for?	You can change it if you want to.
Oh, Charlie again.	Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.	This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.	Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.	I never knew.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?	Enlighten me.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.	You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
What?	"I'm just a bit of a wreck. ""I sleep in your hat"" makes me cry.  Me."
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?	If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
Forget it.	What's that?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?	Glenn talked you out of it.
Had to be done.	No good options left?
Let her speak.	He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.	I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
I will if you shut your piehole.	Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?	Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.	The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
You mean, did I want a date?	Did you?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.	"OK, Scott, no one really wants to ""kill"" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it."
I'm going to wait here until she comes.	Are you sure?
Say it.	Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Anyway, down here, take a look...	McCaffrey, hold this for us.
You don't read, do you?	Never read a book in my whole life.
What is it?	Like this.
Wonderful!	That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
This is not his handwriting.	No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!	Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
And why is that?	Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.	It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Nature ...	... preserve...
May I ask a personal question?	Go ahead.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.	The milkmaid's daughter?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.	What are you doing here?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?	No. I just have short hair.
Right.	We better watch him. He's crazy.
But why? What's the point?	A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...	Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?	Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?	I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
What do you see, Erik?	I see the world.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.	I appreciate your honesty, George.
You're asking me why?	I'm asking.
What shall we do?	Tea would be nice.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.	Oh, yes.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.	I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Yeah!	I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Who?	Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.	Well, where are all of you off to?
I kill someone famous.	Then do it, asshole.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?	How did you know --
A Mass for the dead.	What dead? Who is dead?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.	Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?	wasn't anywhere near this place
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.	Don.
Where are we going?	No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.	Another Martini, Paul?
Why not?	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.	Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?	Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
We don't need to know.	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
Who was your teacher?	I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --	What kind of a dog is he?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.	THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?	Investigator...
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?	YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.	You don't agree with Debbie, then?
The lobby's half filled now.	What are you talking about?
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.	HE'S GONE!
Don't you want answers?	There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...	You've found missing persons before.
What's the problem?	Death.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...	... bottle ...
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?	Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
No, that door over there.	I don't want to die.
"I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know ""niggers"" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I."	I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...	I don't want to talk about him.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.	YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.	Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No...	Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?	Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?	If I was still alive, I probably would.
Yes.	But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --	-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.	Goodbye, Donald.
Mozart -	Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
That is a trifle strong.	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...	Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Getting to what?	The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Oh Jesus Christ...	Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
No, he is here.  Shit...	Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?	Of course.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?	Like how?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.	Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
And if we can't find him?	We'll find him.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?	None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
You cool, Ich?	Cool?
You must think I'm some kind of fool.	It looks delicious.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!	What????
Stanzi!	No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Did you ever steal a car before?	Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Who was he?	She.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.	Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.	Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.	Did you?
What?  What?	Like silk?
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.	All right, they're makin' a movie.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!	It looks like scurvy.
What do you think?	I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
A bad idea.	I got us through the War all right.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.	They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Well, what does it matter to you?	Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.	No. It's not that.
Call me Alex.	Aw come on, Alex!
Where to?	Turn left at the lights.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.	This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.	And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Who?	Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?	No. You never worked Berlin.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.	You feelin' sick?
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...	No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.	I put them on together.
Excuse me?	That's what you want, isn't it?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.	So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.	Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?	I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...	And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.	Thank you, Exposition.
Has his friend appeared to him again?	Yes.
Are you alright?	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I... I don't know...	What don't you know?
But you LOVED her all the same...	We never went to bed together.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?	He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...	They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Yes.	Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?	I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Frank? Can you stand up?	I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
I don't have one.	I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--	But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Mmmerrick.	Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Herr Sommer.	Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!	It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.	Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
I gotta go get a haircut.	Uh-huh.
You couldn't have known --	Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.	Are you going public with this?
To your health, Frank.	Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
No. It's all arranged.	Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!	Yes?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?	Cool.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!	The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.	I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...	Night!
No, thank you, Doctor.	Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
I can't imagine any place better than here.	You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.	No. I should go.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything	I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.	He did?
Why did you quit?	I got scared.
Had his apartment been burglarized?	No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Go back to bed.	Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?	In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --	Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.	Then we've just got shit.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.	Well, that does sound very odd.
You want to see him too, right?	Yes, but.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.	I'm afraid I don't...
Yeah. Big fan.	And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.	For whom else have you worked?
I hear you've got visitors.	Would you guys...
I'll try and make it.	Looking forward!
I'm out.	Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Got my letter?	Yes, thank you.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?	I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Why?	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Hi.	Hi.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.	Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.	I think we should go.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?	I remember everything. All I have are memories.
But there were other factors.	Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?	Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
What do you want?	I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Alright... take it down.	What?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.	Jeffrey!!
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.	For how long?
I know. I had to take the day to think.	Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.	None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Who?	Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
What the hell was that?	Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
What's the worst?	You get the girl.
So help me, Gladys.	Becky was my only shot at state!
What does that mean?	Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
Good on ya, man.	Groovy!
What's she so emotional about?	I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
We're ready when you are.	Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.	But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?	"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?	You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...	I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?	You did not ask me.
Social issues. Crime prevention.	Hand to hand combat?
Plan?	Let's just keep walking.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.	Nice. Very nice.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.	I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
I would think so.	Yeah, I would think so, too.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?	I don't know.
What a charming idea. May I see?	It's just a trifle, of course.
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
What?	What'd they ever do for you?
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?	Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
What's wrong with me?	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
"Okay, um, there's one that goes ""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."""	Is that Nietzsche?
I don't blame you!	Eve, I'm sorry.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.	Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?	I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?	Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.	Oh. I see.
Yeah.	Who's got the car keys?
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?	Got it.
Bloom!	Don.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.	Fuck you.
$50?	I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?	With the tenors.
Rechannel all safety relays --	-- open quantum latches --
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.	I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.	Okay.
William would never have gone to a state school.	William didn't even go to high school
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.	Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.	Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
No, Cole, I...	It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
That girl -- I --	You burn, you pine, you perish?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?	Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
You dump her and I'll give you cash.	What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
It won't work like that.	Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
How'd you find me?	Wasn't that hard.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?	Never
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.	It's possible.
Please...	They're prisoners to their genes.
Well you're not reading it right!	Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
The ten dollars.	Oh, ten dollars
You're not okay.	I just need to lie down for awhile
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?	She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?	No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Are you afraid?	Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
He'll double what I pay you.	Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
It's nice to see you.	It's nice to see you.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?	That bugs you too?
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?	You don't understand me.
No. Not me, boss.	Then don't have a drink.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.	No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
That's a canopy, John.	Ohhh...
Hello, bomb.	False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.	See you Monday. Sir.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.	Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?	No, John, not one that I can see.
You think I'm fake.	Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.	Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Why?	Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Well.	Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.	Don't you think I know it?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.	It's the truth.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?	Right.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?	Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
You can't come in.  They don't want --	Gaiijin.
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!	Yes ma..
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.	So simple to say, so hard to do.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.	Hi
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?	My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
A model? An actor?	No. Flattering, but no.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.	If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.	It means a lot...that you came.
I came on a bus.	Why doesn't that surprise me?
You have nine points left on your license..	Thanks for reminding me..
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?	Yeah, lots.
With grenadine, right?	When I was twenty.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?	What do you mean?
You got that?	No, I don't get that!
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.	Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --	-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
Was it worth it?	Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?	Looking for a job.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.	Don't threaten me, Bob.
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.	Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?	You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Destroy all that which is evil...	...so that which is good may flourish
Sooner or later that's everybody.	Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!	"Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the ""new blood"" is *for*!"
Yes, ma'am.	Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Are you married?	Divorced.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.	Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
What do you mean?	For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
Don't swear.	Yes ma'am.
I'm not going.	Why not?
Certified ladies' man, huh?	She's also moorish.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.	I'm tired of this.
Because you're getting on that plane.	I don't understand. What about you?
Helping people makes me happy.	I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...	But you LOVED her all the same...
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...	Okay.
Did you change your hair?	No.
Yes?	There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.	"No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out."
He wasn't acting?	I don't think he knows how.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?	Yes.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.	How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Yeah.	Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!	I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.	I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.	It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
What about... The money?	What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.	Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
How's the weather down there?	Mr. Henry?
It doesn't go like that.	Who asked you?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.	Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Promise me you'll come back.	I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Teasing you is completely unfair.	What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.	So?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?	You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Well. Okay.	Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.	Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.	Nurse!
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?	I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.	Why do you do it?
Kill them both.	Here?
He's gone.	Uh-huh.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?	Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!	Gladys! Stop it!
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.	What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Going somewhere, Margie?	I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
To tell you the truth -- you did.	Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Sure, cousin.	"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""
"""One: Please don't smoke in bed."""	We heard that one already, Homer.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?	I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Kitty...	The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Why?	Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!	Wow.
I'm wid it.	I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.	Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?	Good idea.
Yeah?	That doesn't bother you, does it?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.	Who?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?	What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Sssh!	Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...	But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?
Hey, bomb.	The only thing which exists is myself.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?	Sure.
I was talking to the cat.	Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.	What are you talking about?
Shit. We don't know what he is.	Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Yes? What is it?	Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Yeah, I saw it.	I'm lookout.
Why?	Because I'm so horny.
Over this?	Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?	Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Get out!	How many people go here?
You should have.	Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?	Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
That's gotta kill him, right?	Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.	Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.	Yes, ma'am.
Don't need it. I remember everything.	Sounds like a threat.
Just one... why me?	Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
Sophy?  Are you okay?	Mommy, where are you?
I'm not just saying it!	Nor I!
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.	Well, look at them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.	You want me drunk?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?	She was ...
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.	But what is it they don't like?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.	That's...that's too bad.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?	I can't tell you.
You're a superstitious fucker.	Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.	A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --	I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.	Just curious.
Yes sir.	Just perfect.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?	You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.	Uh huh.
Tonight?	Alone.
Send for my car...	His Excellency's car!
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?	Shit! Shit!
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.	Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.	That's okay. I --
Whaddya mean? We got dick.	You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.	Oh, he won't be followed here.
What is it?	The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.	Yeah. okay.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?	Well, I
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.	Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?	Yeah!
Harold!	Close up shop!
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.	I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Web died fighting?	Died a hero.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.	I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?	We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
I am trying.	Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I like that.	No.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.	Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Bastard's got his high beams on.	Shit.
You told them I raped you -- why?	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why?	Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Er, goodbye, sir.	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.	Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Yes.	"Excellent! Now, say... ""Hello"""
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.	There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?	Guess who wrote it?
Hey, you're right.	You're hopeless.
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
Hi, Jack.	Hi, David.
She was a witch.	No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.	And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.	June, July ... August?
I was dreaming.	What were you dreaming about?
Well, it is kind of a long shot...	It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.	I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Robert...?	What are you doing here?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --	What?
No. Flattering, but no.	Well...
There's no disease, I can tell you.	Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?	Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.	It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I thought everything was working out fine.	Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.	Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
What?	Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
A cop...	I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
You? Why?	Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
You are false data.	Huh?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?	There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
Yes.	She's not in the gaming business is she?
How's our deal coming along?	Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Open the door. We're late.	I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
So it didn't feel... weird?	Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Get the presents and do the lights.	You bet.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.	Why not? It was just money.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.	Good. It's supposed to be.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?	You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
My dear President...  read it back...	"""My dear President""..."
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.	He got his deer yet?
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Clean?	Don't blow your nose!
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.	Just for him?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...	Who?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.	So... that's it?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.	Hi, Lenny.
You will die! It will be awful!	Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
That could be anybody's.	They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Are you lost?	Nope - just came by to chat
Nerves of steel.	No rust?
I'm busy.	He just wants to --
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?	He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.	Frost?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?	Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
You want me to check?	I said good call.
Beth? I can't believe it.	Believe it.
Give me the address!!	Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.	1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
But - what can we accomplish?	We can <u>ram</u> him!
You remember what happened next?	I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
You got absolute zero.	Show me where you buried her.
You are married?	Was.  Divorced.
And don't you worry about it.	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?	Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.	Of course.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!	So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.	Go on.
Take your time.	What?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.	I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Hmmmm.	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
I don't remember.	It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.	Anyone?
Unlikely.	And because he's my friend.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.	Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.	Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
Yeah. Let's keep it --	Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
What exactly are you working on?	I can't say. Really
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.	We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Oh, Wade.	I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?	Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
Yes.	I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.	Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.	Meaning?
And never take.	Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
...too early...	...then what about...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.	We should go out on a double date.
I brought the girl remember?	The girl?
Who was that?	No one.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.	Possible.  So you did those wings?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...	What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.	No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.	Yes. Here's your ticket.
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .	Me?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.	So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...	You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?	No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.	I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.	Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.	It was Freddy.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....	Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.	Together we stand!
Possibly. Split personality ...	Insane ... ?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...	"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
What is --	Just take it.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!	You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You didn't want to farm?	I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
I can't see a bloody thing.	Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?	All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.	Oh, no.
You don't like this, I take it?	Come on, you're prettier than that.
Tempestuous?	"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
Looks like you know a song.	Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Tomorrow is the full moon.	That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.	This is the end of the chase.
Nobody cares, Ronald.	Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
But I don't know how to polka.	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.	What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.	Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Well, let's roll, George.	To the... to the beach?
Yes, John.	You did this for me?
It that mother real?	Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?	Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
What?	Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Have they located my daughter yet?	Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.	I had to ask.  I apologize.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.	Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Yes, Patrick?	Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Elaine!	Ted!
Where's your partner?	The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --	I don't know!
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.	Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
What's a nanny do?	She looks after other people's children.
Really.	There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?	Um...uh...
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.	I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.	You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.	He left with Sophie.
Yeah, right.	What was that, Korfin?
Yeah, well...	Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
You swine!	Give me that again!
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?	I was awake and he was in my room.
Child pornography.	There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.	Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Not now!	Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Boss, let's get out of here.	No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.	That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.	Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Still...	For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
German!	Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
She looks after other people's children.	Did you grow up around here?
Ed... you're kinky!	The phone made me do it!
Pretty.	Hmmmm.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!	Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.	Fourteen? --
Now, now. He's a good boy.	Shit. We don't know what he is.
Yeah?	He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --	Then you've gotta ask him about that.
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...	...Like love...
Fine.	It's none of your business.
Not at all?	You know how your Daddy is.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.	May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.	You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Had in mind something a little more radical.	What's the problem?
That's lame, isn't it?	You'll come up with something.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.	Okay.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.	You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
What exactly did he call out?	He said 'Jack'.
I'm here for movies.	Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.	"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?	No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?	Fallout shelter.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.	You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
You mean like techniques?	Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
She hasn't got any.	She MUST have a knife or something...
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.	The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.	Lucky girl.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.	Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.	Your ranch?
Mrs. Peel -- ?	Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --	Put it down!
Maybe you ought to buy me one.	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.	Did you shoot the rapids?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --	Poor fucker my ass...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...	Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Why not? It's a question.	Love is... love is... love is...
And? What are you saying?	And. It's wrong.
Speak English!	You said speak Czech!
I said, ask your wife.	My wife?
Commander, I have to log it...	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
That's better.	Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...	We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Watch out, you're on my hair!	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
What is this? You guys cops or something?	We're not cops.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.	Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.	Wow... read something.
You get an equal cut.	What do I have to do?
How many?	Three, maybe more!
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?	As much as possible.
Thorfinn! You can't die!	I'm not frightened... of anything...
I think he's a Jew.	Why on earth do you say that?
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?	We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?	Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
How much of that story is true?	Everything but the boring parts.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.	You sound real remorseful.
What?	Bob! Get back in position!
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...	Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Yes.	You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.	I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.	If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?	He doesn't speak English.
What's that for?	Luck.
You don't trust me?	As far as you trust me.
They gonna rush us?	They're just insurance in case we run.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.	That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
I could get it out of him.	You're not listening.
No thanks.	Don't worry, I won't report you!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?	I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.	And I was wondering.
Are you gettin' wise with me?	No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Oh, no.	What?
I haven't read that.	I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...	WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
You know Wilmont?	Yeah.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.	No, before my time.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?	I'll do what I can.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.	I'll check it.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.	Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Orders.	To kill me?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?	Twenty-five years.
Oh yeah?	Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
What's your name?	Pris.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.	Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.	Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
I know. Stop it.	Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?	Come on.
Why?	I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.	He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
I suppose we're both old men now.	You'll always be older than me, Father.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.	But! I'm a married woman!
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.	I don't know they just always need it.
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
Did he tell you how we finally met?	Nobody cares, Ronald.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?	No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.	Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
The poet? What ever happened to him?	He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!	Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.	What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
I have to see Bud Kruger.	Do you have an appointment, sir?
Understandable.  Lime?	No, really. I'm okay.
That's just a dream, William!	We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.	People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.	You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?	How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.	Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
He doesn't gamble.	I'll watch.
...not that time...	So when are you comin' to pick us up?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.	It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Something stupid.	Good boy.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.	This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?	Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
What was he after?	There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
You think they sold me out? No way.	He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Yes, Captain?	Did you decide on a runway yet?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...	No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.	Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?	What business?
Really?	Ah, now! Here she comes.
Is he...	He's alive.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?	But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
I'm not.	Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --	I didn't shoot West --
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?	No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!	Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.	Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.	It's good to see you.
When?	I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.	Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Apparently he has the letters.	Yes?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?	No. I'm all alone.
-- You remember.	Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.	I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?	Yeah.
That's right.	We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
All right, cop. I want my money.	It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Just give me a hand.	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
That took some fun out of --	We're not gonna let it.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.	Well, this isn't really a party per se.
What if it was just one guy with six guns?	Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.	We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
But... what will you do?	I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!	You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
At least you were never lonely.	I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?	I will join my grandfather there.
What is this?	A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
You flatter me.	Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Oh, shit!	Grandma Death.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?	Very much so.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?	Yes.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.	A common thief.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.	I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Excuse me.	We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --	-- What are you doing here?
I'll hurry back.	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
That's true. That would give me nightmares.	Bob, I've got nightmares.
Shit. Who hasn't?	Why you say that?
I never agreed to that.	Bob, you're lying!
How long?	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Yeah.	Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.	Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
So what do you think?	I'm strangely comfortable with it.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.	Do you have a Salon Prive?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?	Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.	That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?	Busy
Don't give me this, we were partners.	Billy, go ahead, break it...
Number three.	Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it	That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?	I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.	I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.	And the result satisfies.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.	Let's waste him.  No offense.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.	It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.	No.  I mean your relationship.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?	Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Is that how Larry feels?	Uh. Not exactly.
"There's still something wrong with it... take out ""President"" ...now what've you got?"	"""My""..."
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.	I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.	To my health.
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!	Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Thanks, miss.	You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.	Mrs.?
Why... why didn't you tell me?	Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
Give the guy a shot.	Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
Something wrong?	The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Any tips on where these guys may be?	Any word back from the E.R.s?
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Jeffrey? Why?	I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.	Yeah? Airtight?
"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"	Why didn't you tell me?
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?	The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
Man, you got a bad attitude.	I like to keep it professional, that's all.
You mean soap?	Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.	Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.	But why would they --?
He isn't to be touched.	He's a good man.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.	But I've seen her grave.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?	I can.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?	Home.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.	Why?
It's been a long time.	Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
I slept very well.	That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I meant did you find other stuff to --	Oh. Yeah.
Sir, I'm a British officer.	It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.	I don't know what I've got.
On the contrary.	Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Sun's gettin high.	Deers have ears too.
We're getting a little old for running.	"Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like ""twenty-five to life"" pissed."
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?	Sure have...
Death.	I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Were you in Cluett's apartment?	Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Pittsburgh?	Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.	You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?	Sure.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
He has a great body	Everybody has a great body now.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?	I'll just drive my car.
But I might not have.	Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!	You think I don't know that?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.	It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Nervous?	A bit.
Hey, Murph.	Roc. You okay?
What's wrong?	I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.	I'm sure.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.	I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
It's a secret.	You don't have secrets from me.
Some.	Tell me about them.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.	But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.	That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?	Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
How does that make you feel?	It reminded me of my dog Callie.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.	I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.	I am very pleased to meet you.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?	Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Time?	"Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  ""GE joins Outpost in new venture,"" which means NBC is out. ""Disney joins Outpost,"" ABC is out. ""Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,"" Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!"
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.	Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?	You're goddamn right I am!
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?	I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Veil nebula.	Who cares?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?	No.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.	You're sick of my company?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.	If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...	I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Eve?!	Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.	Well. Okay.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.	Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
You hate me don't you?	I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.
What?	The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.	I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
I used it to start the fire --	Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
I was awake and he was in my room.	But, David.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.	Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
What's he scanning for?	PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
I had you pegged, didn't I?	You had the whole human race pegged.
Louder, pal, louder.	Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...	...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --	If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
I used an accelerant.	Yeah?  What kind?
What...?  Why?	Because he knows how to get to our man.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --	-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?	Uh huh.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.	Go to sleep, Charlie.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.	Oh!
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.	I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
He went home sick.	Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Did I say thanks?	No.
Huh?	I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?	Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
For whom else have you worked?	No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?	Nice.
Your father never means to be so...	I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.	Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
What've you got for me?	I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!	He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
I asked first.	Sometimes I think I do.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.	Thanks.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?	Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Right!	This is fun.
Nothing?	Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
I have my orders.	Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
I can't.	I'm thinking Dorsia.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?	He's terribly busy, sir.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?	Hallelujah, Jaffar.
But what about the past? Our past?	We never really shared one.
You don't have to say anything	What? I... I wasn't saying...
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.	Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Yes please, two.	One or two?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--	A fog bank.
Why?... Why would you need me?	Because...
The Fire.	What time?
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!	How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
You fancy him.	I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...	...this is Conklin's computer.
Surveillance? By whom?	Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Looks good. How much did it cost?	I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.	I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?	Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Lovely.	The bedroom.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.	Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Catch you back at the wall.	Later.
Uh-uh.	Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
The only thing which exists is myself.	Bomb?
How many days until you come home?	Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.	Oh, Wade.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!	Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.	Some kids were teasing you?
Then I demand an apology!	That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.	Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I don't know.	Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.	I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...	Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?	Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Why, yes, of course.	You start.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.	You're just saying that.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?
What?	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Thank you. honey.	It's okay. It's okay.
What was she like?	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Get away, Snorri.	What have you got there?
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.	No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.	Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.	I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.	When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.	What about E.M.S. recombination?
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?	And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?	There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.	No one's ever left.
Oh, let's not talk about it.	Why not?
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.	And I'm the feet.
I'm sorry..	This is a police control action..
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.	Well, life's not fair. We know that.
He, I'm Mona.	Hi, Mona.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.	I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.	They'd frame him.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.	Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?	We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.	Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
The river.	The river?
Where you going?	Move.
Think of what?  We're fucked.	What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Yeah, you told me that later.	I told you that later.
A lot?	Enough.
Good morning.	Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.	Kitty...
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.	Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.	Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.	Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
John Steed.	Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.	What did you see?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?	Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
Frank is coming?	No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!	Yes, you are. You're very sick.
It's... too slow.	Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Is this to be an empathy test?	Yes.
Got anything to drink in there?	Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.	I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
I don't want to talk about this here.	Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.	Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
You guys awake?	We're here.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.	It was just the ether, Wilbur...
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.	Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
What, again?	This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...	You're mad.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.	Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.	Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
I've heard.	Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
She's grown up some, hasn't she?	Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.	What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?	I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.	In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Where's Kumar?	I don't know.
If you say you are.	I most definitely say I am.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...	Tell me.
Stop it! Just cut it out!	You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
Who do you think the Jap is?	Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Who is on this committee?	Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Make the call.	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.	Have a seat.
Well, do you still plan to get married?	Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.	Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...	Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
What's she doing?	Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Headquarters!? What is it?	It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?	We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.	Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?	I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.	It might have.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!	What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?	You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
"""My President""..."	"There's still something wrong with it... take out ""President"" ...now what've you got?"
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.	There's a million places to hide around here.
Billy, go ahead, break it...	No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
It's okay.	Stick around, please?
Ha! Where's that?	The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
...What's your name?	Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?	Don't be stupid.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.	How do I know you're telling the truth?
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...	I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.	Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Gee... What makes you say that?	Your life flashing before your eyes?
Alright.	Let's go.
Listen, what about dinner?	"Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about fucking dinner?"""
We've already been inspected.	Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
And the year before that?	"""U.S.A. is A-okay."""
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.	Anything else?
I had to give some to Inez.	How much?
That I'm used to.	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?	Patrick? I can't hear you.
What happens if you level with her?	Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.	Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Yeah, well, you're late.	Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.	It's all about the money, isn't it?
Great place for lunch.	Yeah, one of my favorites.
And the bite marks on my ears?	Yes...
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.	"Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?"
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.	Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.	No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Calls?	We'll use the Euc.
It would be my child.	Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Aren't you tired?	If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
What?	Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!	They are robots!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...	I find that hard to believe.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.	Growing. I'm glad you said that.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...	Yes!
How many victims are up there?	There are two bodies found at this point.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.	Your father never means to be so...
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.	NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
Dr. Evil?	Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?	I don't want to drag you down with me.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.	You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Thank you.  You have one?	A wife.  She left.
Alright.	Alright.
What are you doing?	It's freezing out here.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?	Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.	Indeed!
Yeah, I guess so.	Really?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.	But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
How'd it go?	Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
The last one you'll ever see.	Perish the thought.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.	So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?	Uh-uh.
Never. Why do you ask?	I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I owe a lot of money.	Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
No, you weren't	Then why'd you ask?
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?	About - thirty-four seconds.
Yes -- I believe you do.	Then let go!
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?	Marion. It's a book.
...at twenty-thirty hours.	One more time in English.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.	They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Yes?	Mr. Sampson . . .
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
You're talking about the woman I love.	I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Did you get his number?	I know who it is.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...	What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!	Options.
That's good.	Yeah.
You don't have squat.	You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.	The debts.
Do what?	You know.
Thank God...	What the fuck are you doing?
C'mon.  It's not that bad	Try lookin' at it from this angle
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.	You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?	She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
I don't call him, I whistle.	What do you whistle?
I'm Lucy.	And what do you do, Lucy?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.	Was it funny?
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?	Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
I see that you're expecting.	Oh, yes.
"Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely."	Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Black?	Please.
Mob?	Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?	Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.	Do you have your own cell?
What'chu sayin'?	What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?	Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.	No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Your parents'd kill you.	Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.	Some women like Dobermans --
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?	Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.	An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
I thought you were above all that	You know what they say
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.	Whereas you are.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.	Really?  Since when?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.	My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Yes	I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.	Yes, sir.
Who are they of?	Oh, our relatives... the children.
I have an idea for that.	What?
Every entry was authorized.	Keep looking.
I'm right here.	I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!	I can't let you do that either.
Why? People fart backwards.	Do you think that's funny?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?	What?
Name it.	Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?	I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
...no, she didn't...	...yes she did.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!	I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...	Sure...
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --	-- hang on --
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.	I am committed. I love you.
The Indian rope-trick.	Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Nice. Very nice.	Thanks.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?	Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
No.	Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?	Yes.
Hey.	How's it going?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...	It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
...above Murmansk, and Finland.	Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
That's so typical, isn't it?	It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
Hello.	Hi, it's me...
Of course, luv.	Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
A monster. I know, I know.	You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.	Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?	All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Yeah.	You better get over to Al's. Now.
We're drunk.	Oh yeah.
I don't give out the details.	Last night, two nights ago, three?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.	It's not true.
Goodnight.	Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
Where's Ma?	She's coming.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...	Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hey.	You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.
What the bell happened?	I lost them, that's what happened.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.	And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
One man.  He must be good.	Then go get him.
Yes.	Is there a part for me?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.	If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?	I know a lot more than that
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.	Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.	How long will I be in here?
You're right.	Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I didn't think there was an alarm.	Take him to the car, Bob.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?	That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Walk away, Jack.	Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
You're my prisoner.	I've got something to tell you.
You're in this up till ya neck.	Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
How?	First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
Of course not.	Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.	You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.	So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?	I feel much better. Thank you.
And...?	Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.	Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
You're right. We should sit in silence.	We're in the middle of a murder case --
Nurse!	The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Okay.	Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I'm sure.	The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
What kind of test?	Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.	Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
My mom wanted me to have this?	Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.	Hold it.
He's good-looking.	Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
CONTINUED	Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Lillian!	Where's Jill?
What do you think?	Well.... er...
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!	I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I missed you.	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Watery headed bunch.	I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Don't know.	Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
My point exactly.	I'm serious here.
Warn him?	Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.	Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --	Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Is that all?	Take another letter...  to my tailor.
Really?	No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Wait! I know how we can get in!	Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Hello... ?	Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Maybe.	You and Mel Gordon?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.	Yeah?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Are you playing a trick on me?	I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?	What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
What am I gonna do?	Listen, what's your name?
How?	I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
"So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like ""IHOP.""  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."	Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Yeah, who's this?	I know what you did.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.	Thanks a lot.
What did you want for Christmas that year?	Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.	No way they could have seen it?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?	So?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.	What?
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.	Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.	Yes, but he was a cop.
Surely you're not suggesting...	David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...	Or what?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.	Stay with her.
Now, don't get into any trouble.	Take care.
"Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No, ah... ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."""	Sparkling rocks?
And what's this right girl like?	Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
What did he say?	You owe me three-fifty.
That's Anthony.	That's your friend Anthony?
With all my heart, Mozart.	Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.	Tell me about it, please!
That's what I'm askin'.	Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.	What about time...?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.	Money.
How's she doing?	Okay. She's fine.
Send in the next girl.	By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.	David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.	You don't celebrate til it's over.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.	You know what? I think that you did it.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?	I know your parents.
Did it go well, darling?	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Then what?	Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
I figured.	Was it worth it?
There's a furnace.	You're not using it today?
I was on call.	I want you on call here.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?	That's right.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.	"Say ""goodnight"" to Sandy."
Good morning, Treves.	Good morning, sir.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.	Thank Christ for that.
Joel!	I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Really.	Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
I'd like to... take you out or something.	Well, you're married.
"Say the words, ""I understand."""	I understand.
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.	He was lucky...  Sit there.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!	Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?	And I made these!
Get out!	The engine is still running.
I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.	I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.	Oh, sure!
And thanks for always being happy!	What?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?	Crystal.
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.	"Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- ""D"" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?"
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.	Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
"""The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."""	Hey!
The Slaughtered Lamb?	Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?	Of course not.
This... is my new home?	Yes.
It is not allowed.	We're police officers.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.	The nocturnal flying mammal?
Any good?	It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.	Yeah, I heard of it.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.	Did you hurt her?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...	-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.	We did talk about Naomi.
Fix raft first.	Water water water --
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.	Not like Matt, you mean.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--	The human?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!	Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Don't make me have to use this.	I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?	You look nice today.
What do you want?	Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What do you think?	Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.	I'm sorry I'm late.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?	Why?
Everybody in?	I guess so.
Oh, baby, what's going on?	I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.	It's difficult.
Can I take your picture?	You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?	Yeah.  What?
Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?
"Uh huh. And ""Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins"". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?"	Management were pin heads.
But it ends up the same.	One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
I have to leave. Tonight.	Why?
But you did suspect me.	Not for a moment.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?	Lay off, asshole.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.	I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
You saw the ad in the Times?	No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Do you think a lot about girls?	Yes.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?	Alright.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.	You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!	Rocco!
Why do you say that?	We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
They took my daughter.	I know.
Yeah, Sykes?	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.	Right.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.	That 50 G could help you --
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?	"Last year? It was, ""Buy American."""
How was the meeting?	Sobering...
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.	We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?	How did you start the fire this time?
Nope.	Then I love it.
Had a package to deliver.	You?  Personally?
Hey, there she is...	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Some service deserves service in return. No?	What do you mean?
Sometimes a wound will kill.	Now you tell us.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.	I'm wid it.
So, Mrs...	Candy. Candy Kendall.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?	Yes.
For a while.	How's she doing?
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.	Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.	Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Must have taken a hell of a long time.	Time I had lots of.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!	Not now, Sven...
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:	Scale the --
So what's the point?	Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.	Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?	We'll find out soon enough.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.	That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
You alright?	y-y-yes--
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.	Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Says who?	You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Yes?	Be careful.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.	Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?	I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Not at all, John.	I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]	I speak English.
Your daughters went to the prom.	Did I have anything to say about it?
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.
You made me look like an idiot --	Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.	Good for you.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.	Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.	There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Is it back in?	Yeah.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.	Why not?
A hunting accident is perfect.	Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
You are a charmer.	I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.	Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --	What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
How can I convince you to stop?	Go out with me.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.	Thanks.
A little modesty would suit you better.	Who is on this committee?
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.	I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
He wants to kill US!	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.	I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Two weeks holiday.	How much money are you carrying with you?
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
Oh, make that uniform blue.	Yes, sir.
He got beat up by a girl.	If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Exactly!	Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
As long as he gets out OK.	Obviously. That's a given.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.	Hi. Pat Bateman.
Did you see her undressed?	Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?	I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I'm sorry.	Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I'm not leaving you.	I am so ashamed.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?	Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Yes.	See my nipples?
What color hair does he have?	Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.	Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.	But what about us?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.	But not to last.
Rats! I've lost number three.	What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
I ain't done --	WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...	Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Chulo, one thing at a time.	Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
"Fuck ""you're serious"", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it."	Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?	Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.	Smashing idea! Give it to me.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!	Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
What if it's not who you think it is?	If he crosses the bridge, it is.
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?	If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
Yep, you guessed it.	"This could be bigger than ""Amos and Andy."""
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....	I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!	Hi Ma...
What is it, Treves?	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
But there's no more drug.	You understand that.  But how many others will?
He's here.	Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Ilene, are you crazy?	I know what I'm doing... Go!
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?	How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.	He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.	All of us.  Right?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.	But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
You seem surprised to see me.	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!	So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.	Nothing on Hannah?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.	I will if I can, Frank.
Would you like to talk about this friend?	His name is Frank.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?	This one's history. Moving on...
Can we come in?	Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.	Gary?
That bruise has cleared up nicely.	Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.	Really? No kidding?
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.	Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
There's a young girl to see you.	What does she want?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.	I'll see you in a minute.
Twenty minutes?	You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
How is your financial situation?	It couldn't be better.
Some... What does that mean?	There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?	"I see ""elegant."""
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.	You're saying this only to make me go.
Milo --	I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?	We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?	Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Donnie?	Yeah?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.	We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
The voltage looks fine.	Then check the connections.
Let the law --	Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.	Good luck, Austin.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.	Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.	Thank you for fucking up my life.
"""We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."""	Okay. We're ready.
Buttfucks the cabin?	And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Promise?	I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.	Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
What did you say?	Our saviour...
You bet your ass he will.	Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.	Mmm.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?	No, I'm not. I need a job.
Father Marchena!	Passion is something one cannot control!
Well?	It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.	Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Yeah.	What's her name?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.	I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?	Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
I feel fine.	Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Yes, Monsieur.	A champagne cocktail, please.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.	No way. You have this -- destiny.
Sit down.	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?	No, I'm okay.
Right. It was extremely stupid.	I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.	Can't it wait, then?
I had a good time last night. I really did.	So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
How long will I be in here?	I don't know. These things take time.
Twenty-five? Around there.	I guess living up here makes people look older.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...	...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
What?	They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.	What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --	Amnesia?
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...	I'm already married ...
Where are we sending it?	White House Situation room.
You are a private investigator?	That's right.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...	Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
But my sleeping is really fucked up.	I don't think I've slept in a year.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?	Are you going to put a spell on me?
Dignan.	Anthony. Bad news.
See what?	The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.	I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I need to talk to her.	Can't help you.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?	I think so.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?	Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
In the living room.	Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.	Much better.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?	Been having bad dreams.
KIMBALL.	Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.	Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Well, you can. You always could.	Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?	He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.	Zee, I'm pleased you came.
What?	Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.	Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Get water!	Fix raft first.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.	I was having a nightmare.
The main spire.	The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
What?	Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Gimme your gun, boy!	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.	You scare me.
She's a big girl.  She understands.	How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Now you get up! And you get in my house!	Or what?
What if he's on the level?	Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.	Why not?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.	Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
You did Basic here?	Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?	What do you think?
I bet you have loyal customers.	You liked what I brung ya?
It used to make me laugh, but.	I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!	What is it?
If he won't cooperate?	Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --	"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"
I know that. But --	You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
You're my only son...	I know, Dad.
What do we need another Shill for?	Breasts.
Yes.	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Thank you.	Well, how's it going back there?
What did he have?	He had fish.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.	Weirder than this?
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.	They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.	What?
I know.	He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?	Yes.  Both.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.	Twenty minutes?
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.	Gary, you're quite an animal.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.	Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Are you scared?	Not really. Maybe a little.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?	One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?	That's what I just said
People aren't that simple.	If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
You'll be there?	Eight A.M. flight.
Excuse me. I really must he going.	No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.	Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?	Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
The Bruce is not coming, William.	Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
We must sue for peace.	Peace?!
Who are the other characters?	Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
What?	Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
Kitty...	Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
No way.	Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
No.	Have you had any before?
You feel?	Yes.
Has anybody offered to buy it?	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Okay, Jason, your move.	Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.	Later.
Yep.	Hitchhiking?
Tick-tock...	If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
GOOD MORNING!	Are you AFRAID?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.	What do you want?
Is everything getting worse?	Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?	They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?	I've come to dinnnnnner!
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.	Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?	No.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.	Why there is no other man in my life?
Are you my two o'clock?	No.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.	Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I believe you have a message for him?	Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I don't.	You don't?
Sheep don't count.	Yeah? What about Laura --
Mueller.	Oh, come on --
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.	Huh huh.
Good to see you again.	I should'a remembered the eggs.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.	So?
What good will that do?	What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?	Yes.
Strange!	Come. Let's begin.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.	Sure, Dave, what's up?
Okay.	Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
How about we go somewhere else?	Want to see my raft?
Hello?	Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
How long have you worked at the casino?	Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.	Yeah. I get it.
Okay, let's do it.	Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!	Eve?!
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.	Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Both, actually.	Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
"The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says ""boo."""	What's a King Pin?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.	Like what?
What do we do? We change the scam?	There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Do you know what his budget was?	Excuse me.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?	Go to the prom with me
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?	I'd rather you didn't.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.	What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
What are they doing now?	Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Do you have an appointment, sir?	No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.	I will if they don't send me back.
Uh... at least fifty.	In your dreams! See you tonight!
I think now that he might...	Why?
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.	Uh, Gladys?
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?	I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?	He ain't never been outta Maine!
Where's Sean?	He's got piano lessons.
Yes.	Eat my - ah!
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.	It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.	Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Can't say.	Then who's the Banker?
Patrick?	Ye-es, Je-an?
It was a mutual decision.	You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?	I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
Yeah, it's me.	Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?	Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
He seems like he thrives on danger	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.	Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.	I demand action.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...	Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?	She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!	There is something I must ask the Gods...
Mozart. It was good of you to come.	How could I not?
I think she got to you, pappy.	You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
He's in interrogation?	Yes.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.	What guy?
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.	I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
This has to be a big mistake.	The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hi...	Hi...
I want to go home.	You can't.
He's having a heart attack or something.	Let's go!
Where am I?	The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.	Who do you think the Jap is?
Oh.	"Pitcher. ""Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."""
It's magic.	"What ""magic""?"
Where are you going?	I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
That's *it*?	That's it.
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.	You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
I'm on a break.	Guess again.
One of us?	Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
It was exciting.	But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.	Well, what makes you think I haven't?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.	No. We didn't.
They're gone. What are you --	I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.	But have you ever seen it? Think back...
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!	I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!	Helen.  I appeal to you -
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.	But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'	So what do I tell this guy?
My name's Sophia.	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.	Shit is a French word?
There's this guy!	What?
That ' s completely adorable!	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.	I hope not.
Go ahead.	Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Yes, Basil?	Be careful.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.	I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!	An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.	But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
No, I won't go with you	Why not?
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.	Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
When do you deliver your project?	This afternoon.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!	Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.	I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.	You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.	We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.	I start Monday week.
They hurt his head.	Who, Dorothy?
You must have a visa or something...	You're asking for my documents?
Who's this?	He works for me.
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.
How you feelin' today?	You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
It's beautiful. Thank you.	I hope it brings you luck.
What?	I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?  It doesn't work that way.	If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Care for some saki?	Sak-i it to me!
Take it.	No.
No.	Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.	How was I ridiculing you?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...	God be with us admiral.
Oh, that's nice.	Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
You just stay put.  You need rest.	You don't get it, he's after me...
I have to be home in twenty minutes.	I don't have to be home 'til two.
I think so.	You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Well, I never heard that one.	I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Sir, we stay with the President.	That isn't necessary.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?	"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!	I know. I know.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.	You're all scumbags.
What do you get out of it?	Peace of mind.
By name only.	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.	Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?	Delacroix.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!	Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.	We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.	It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
But now you can't go.	Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?	Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
"You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock."""	I can't stop thinking about you.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.	Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?	Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
But I understand what you mean.	You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.	What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.	Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Who was that?	I don't know.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?	Piece of fucking cake.
Just ask me what you want to know.	Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.	The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.	Oh?
Sobering...	Very funny.
Ted, what's wrong?	Ask Simon.
What's the matter?	I don't know... I just feel scared.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...	Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.	Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
I told you I'd come back.	You did?
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.	That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.	Do ya?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?	It's a good job.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?	Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Twombley involved?	No.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.	Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Please don't...	And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Nine.	Any of us?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!	Fuck it! Hold tight!
THEN WHO DID?!	We did.
You think this'll work?	No fear.
Thought you were going to bring her.	So did I.
I was. What are you reading?	'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
How deep IS the ocean?	Very deep... usually...
You don't understand! It's her father...	Mr. Rose *knows*?
Of course.	And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Fuck you.	Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Are you French?	No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
The final route for the railroad is complete.	I look forward to seeing it.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Yes.	Thank you.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.	This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?	No.
Oh, no, Rick never --	-- Thanks. I will.
No.	I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Y'know what?	What?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.	Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.	Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
What about Margie?	What about her?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?	No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.	I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --	Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
I deserve better than this.	Better'n me?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.	Did you know your mother better?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.	You certainly have a nice place here.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.	You can't buy Wade off.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .	Was it twelve o'clock?
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.	Did you ever...
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?	...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Goodnight.	See ya tomorrow.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?	Sure.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.	That is my least vulnerable spot.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!	Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.	Does he win?
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.	What's the matter with Bjorn?
My gift to you.	Under the table!
And Bourne? Where's he now?	Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You hear me? I believed you.	IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
Put the fucking kettle down.	John.
I know first aid!	Well, you had better!!
What I said before --	Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?	You bloody...
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?	Okay.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?	Yes sir.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.	I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.	I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.	Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Give me that again!	You worm!
What? What do you mean?	I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
So...  That your first time?	Yes'sir.
We better watch him. He's crazy.	Right.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.	Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Jani! Where are you?	Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.	You're not taking my baby!
"""My dear President""..."	That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that what you call it?	"But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called ""On the Street Where You Live.""  You know it?"
I'm separated.	Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
So now you hate all women?	I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
I'd rather you didn't.	What's the problem?
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --	It's okay, really.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.	That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Don't try to stop me!	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Corporal Hicks!?	This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.	Yes.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.	Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
What?	Don't bother.
But in your profession that is a risk.	Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
In the kitchen.	I'll make some for us.
Surely you can't be serious.	I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
What are I doing?	Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Connie...	All right, how's the new partner?
I'm not asking you to marry me.	No. What? No. I know.
Is something the matter?	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
We don't need the tapes --	Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Extraordinary!	She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.	You feel good, not nervous?
You're at Paul Owen s.	Who?
Airsick?	I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
This is a TV show, not a music video.	Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.	I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?	I don't hate you.
That's not possible.	Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.	Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?	Unfair. You are completely unfair.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?	Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.	Ted, please be careful.
You makin' any headway?	She kissed me.
Well, then cut it in half.	I keep it for emergencies.
This isn't homicide school.	My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
Thanks, guys.	I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I love you, Wally.	I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...	Sadie was not a man!
What, then?	Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.	I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Hey, when in Rome --	In Rome, I'll bow.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?	I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Jack, please go away. Please go away.	You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You ain't the kicker, are you?	No, ma'am.
Like a DeLorean.	A metal craft of any kind.
He always look so	Block E?
I just hope this is still good up there.	Mom?
You were not.	I was not.
This should be it...	You said that in the last two places.
Easy, Dad!	"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.	You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.	Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.	Yeah?
You could check. It'd be in his files.	Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Did you try?	Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.	Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
You almost went over your limit.	Fuck you.
What's that?	You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?	who can I say is calling?
Who was the girl you walked off with?	No one.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.	You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.	But listen, Tom, I
What's wrong?	They go.
Oh yes? You always know everything.	Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...	If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
What?  What is it?!	The sky!!!
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.	We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.	You seem to know all about my destiny.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.	Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?	You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?	Yes.
You made me have an abortion.	It was a mutual decision.
Fine.  We gotta him.	So! -- He's on your side, too.
No, M'lord.	Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.	I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Glass?	Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
Look at this.	What?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.	Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
I forgive you.	Me?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?	What are you saying?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.	So why did you come to my casino?
Let me go, Sven.	What are you talking about?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.	I don't give tours.
"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."	Please.
I'm not worth risking your life for.	I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.	But you're the Gods!
Sorry, don't have the time.	No problem.
This is too much. I can't handle this.	I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!	I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
How is he - ?	It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Hey...	Shut up.
Yeah.	You got to be kidding me.
I'm not...	You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?	Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Miles...	Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
I reckoned.	Hell of a war.
Yes, Talby, what is it?	Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.	As in...
Ow!	Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.	Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.	I like it fine here.
I was kidding. People actually live there?	Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
I'm hungry.	Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.	Yeah, I know.
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.	It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.	Roger.
It's not a bank.	It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?	The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?	Yes. He likes windows.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?	Check.
So...	It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.	Nice to meet you.
Riders --	We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.	My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?	Yes... Yes, let's go in.
Dunn.	Sir?
What's this?	It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
How come you were in my truck?	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.	Tell me what happened.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?	Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...	Some time.
Uh... sure.	Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.	Then we'll find another way.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.	I was misinformed.
Seems to be all around...	What about down?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.	You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
My son, no one can speak for God.	Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Exactly. Woah.	Death.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
It's true.	This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.	I don't think he'd feel it.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!	He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
You mean Twombley?	Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
"What about ""60 Minutes."""	"Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  ""CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."""
Wade?	Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Trubshaw again? What now?	Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.	True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
I'll take some.	Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!	Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Jesus, Teddy.	I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.	Which one was that?
Just wanted to see.	You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...	Next assignment?
What are you doing?	High five.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.	An evil petting zoo?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?	...I wouldn't know.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust	What good will that do?
How come I never hearda you before?	I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
And. It's wrong.	And who says what is wrong.
I want 15 on the Mets.	How about 7 1/2?
There is only one bed.	David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
None.	I'll wait.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.	I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.	Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?	I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
Did you hear that?	I heard that.
Our chaperon.	Pity your mother came, too ...
Thanks.	How do you want to pay?
I will if they don't send me back.	They won't until this is over.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.	...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.	What if I don't want it?
I did.	And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.	How many victims are up there?
Perfect, Mr. President.	I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...	What? No you're not..
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...	Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hello, Rick.	Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?	All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.	To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.	Shut up.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.	Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.	I know, honey.  Me too.
I never paid for it in my life.	It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Come in.	Hello.
Partnership?	Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Your mother's not dead.	Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
But it's not true.	"What is ""true?"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.	I walk differently?
What is what?	Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Why what?	Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?	That's very simple. I was home.
Yes?	Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.	Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Now, hold up.	See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
Lord, I'm sorry I...	Please. Go. Just go.
We rented a car.	You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Hello.	I wasn't expecting you.
Are you religious?	No.
Yeah.	Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!	Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?	You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.	You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.	What?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.	These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
How did he do that?	Do what?
Yes?	I never knew that music like that was possible.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.	Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Will you think about it?	How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.	Mr. Thomerson, I...
I'm sorry, I didn't...	It's okay. Don't worry about it.
That's five thousand dollars.	Is it?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.	Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.	What...?  What if I say no?
She didn't know?	Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
I resign.	You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
Dinoine chagantakat!	Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
In 9th.  For a month	Why?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.	Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.	Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.	His Grace is very angry with you.
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --	-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.	Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
He'll take one.	I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.	I don't want to.
No.	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Dr. Homer Wells.	I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.	There was an unavoidable delay.
You no gotta no gun.	Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
No, but I shot some ducks.	If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.	Krueger is reality.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.	Oh, is that what I'm doing?
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.	You've done pretty well.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.	In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
Chest pocket.  Shit!	This is a six-shooter.
Would you like a piece of cake?	No. No thank you.
I forgot some of my stuff.	Your stuff?  Let me see that.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.	I just don't want to go over it any more.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.	Well, where was Patrick?
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.	I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
Why?	You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.	Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.	We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
This is the President.	Yeah, right.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?	Why do you always disrespect me like that?
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!	I know.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.	Any idea when she'll be back?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.	You stay with me...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
That's not right, really, cuz I...	You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
Well, what?	Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Oscar, what's the matter?	I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
I think you'll enjoy this table.	So long, Father.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.	This, this... This is bullshit!
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.	C'mon!
You know a lot about art, I guess.	There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Let's give him half an hour.	So?
Bravo!	Thank-Q!
As much as anybody.	Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.	...What do you mean?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.	I just don't see it.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.	Good night.
Yeah	What do you think?
What did he say?	Look out!
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.	Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?	What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?	I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Dark Valdez.	Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.	I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I am not a doctor.	You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Are you on the Mercury mission?	That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
So are dogs.	They don't have a lot of moving parts.
She's from Cuba.	No kidding.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.	I'm doing you folks a favor --
I'm already married ...	Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.	Well, put it down and come in!
So what do you want?	I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?	Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Alright.	Okay.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...	What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Oh well, you know.	And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Uhh, yeah it does.	You stay out of this, Bob.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.	I'll take a jar of that, too.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.	Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.	Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
In other words, scurvy.	"Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself ""not a doctor""!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble."
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.	Otherwise known as an orgy?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.	Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
I don't know what I've got.	Nothing of any importance, eh?
Stake you?	I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.	Give me two more weeks. Please.
They're not idiots.	Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
You're our best and only friend.	Thank you.
No.	Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?	Yes.
Brian.	Jennifer.
You got my cell. Leave a message.	It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
You hurt it?	I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
What?	That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"	I shouldn't have come.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?	Oh, yes.
Course and speed?	Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.	Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Take a letter.	Who to?
When EVIL returns so shall we.	We will be ready, Lord.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.	"Baloney.  I do see the damn ""big picture."""
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?	No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.	Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.	In your opinion.
Lyla Devereux.	Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Is that everything?	Yes.
Bye... sorry...	Yeah... well...
You are, and it's behind you.	Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
I think so.	Sing it back.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.	But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.	You could charge him what you like.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!	Why? What has happened?
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.	Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
Yes'sir.	You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.	Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
ROW!	DEATH!
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?	Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.	How much?
I'll handle it.	We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
This is healing?	Sometimes a wound will kill.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.	Oh, behave!
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.	Sure, what is it?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.	Tammy Curry?
Was he cheated?	In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.	Prick.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.	Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.	That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.	Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Her favorite uncle	Dead at forty-one.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.	I have a job.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.	That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.	Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know, where are yours?	I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?	Only a very little, as soldiers do.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.	Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.	My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?	He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.	I mean for Ted.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.	May I ask by whom?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.	I thought you hated those people.
What?	Is that OK?
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.	I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.	Three of us will never fit in there!
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.	Show me.
Something else.	Okay. Promise?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.	Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!	These are really swell! I mean swell!
"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."	That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --	I'm not gonna let that happen.
Yes?	Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Now I think we really do understand one another.	Right... Right.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?	I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
What'd you say?	Where is the subway station, please.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.	You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!	Toward the Pole!
Patrick, we're in the middle of --	She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?	Energy shielding positive function.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.	Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...	He's sick.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...	Perhaps he will listen to you...
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.	Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Yes, my love?	These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
We must run in different directions!	We don't split up!
Yah-sure, fine... fine.	Okay... well, bye.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.	Good cop/bad cop?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.	Thirty -five years!
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.	Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Thank you.	Had a close one, eh?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...	What -- rape?
Here I am, my angel.	What? Who the devil are you?
Perry?	Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Where are we now?	Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
There was a message, wasn't there?	It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Who did you kill?	Holy shit. Who? How many?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -	Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Frank?	You want to see him too, right?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.	What?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.	No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.	No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.	Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.	No kidding?
Does it eat?	Come on.
How long do you have to go?	26 weeks.
What's all the panic about?	The Dragon...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?	Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Good! How is the patient?	He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?	"We said ""no questions."""
That's right.	We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Papa!	Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!	Are you finished?  You okay?
This is only a vaudeville.	Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Oh, hi, mom.	NOW!
You're serious.	You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?	Sleeping.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?	Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute...
Listen, did you want to make love?	Make love?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...	And what?
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
Yeah?	The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?	What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?	Would you excuse me?
What if you change your mind?	They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
That's what it's about.	Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
No, Victor, there isn't.	I love you very much, my dear.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Okay, I'll take it all.	Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
How so?	Don't you watch the news?
They mean it.	Who's they?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.	Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Just get in the car, Bob.	What's his name?
All Europe shall hear of this!	As you please.
Two at nine? Perfect.	There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?	Alright. I'll think about it.
Had a close one, eh?	Yes, rather.
Ilene, Rick promised...	Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?	Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
Or what?	I told you to TURN BACK!
Did you call the cops?	Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
No. Don't answer it!	Why?
How curious ...	Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?	There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.	Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.	1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Just. Like. Jason.	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
She's so sexy.	I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?	It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.	Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
What did he say?	He says he feels safe here.
Hi, it's Joel.	Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.	It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?	Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!	I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Yes.	Do you follow or should I speak slower?
I thought you were divorced.	I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
You're sure?	What? The tapes?
How so?	To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Hi, can I come in?	Yeah, hurry up though.
What do you want?	I want to come in.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.	But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Mouth's clean, too.	Clean?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?	Take it off. I want to see you.
No, please.	I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
Let's go.	Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.	I think about that.
"Intermitant failure in scan mode ""R"". Analyze."	Negative.
Hope...	... love ...
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.	No?
You think I don't know that?	We're lost!
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...	No... no... no...
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.	Ah, negative drop.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'	Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.	That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.	It's safe here.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?	<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.	I've noticed.
It's the last one.	Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
Austin, what's your point?	Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Hardly.	Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.	Thanks.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.	Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.	I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!	GOOD MORNING!
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.	I don't have nothing.
No! No, it's him!	Who?
Are you Jenny Hill?	I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.	And still it fits?
What's that, written on the sail?	My epitaph.
WE'RE HOOKED!	We're hooked. Hove into position.
Well, what should we do?	I don't know! I just said that!
He left with Sophie.	What?!!
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.	That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?	I'm not sick.
No, you're right.	I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.	Who is she? Where does she live?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.	If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
I don't want anyone to die.	Except for Small Eyes.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?	The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.	But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.	Chart says he's from New York.
Guaranteed, eh?	Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
But we were so careful.	We pushed it. We got lazy.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Elaine!	Ted!
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.	I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.	Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!	Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.	I'm right here.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...	Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...	If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.	You don't have to say anything
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.	Well, not really, I --
1922. Why the kippers?	Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I know, but...	Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!	That son of a bitch.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!	Young man, stop right there!
Pleasure to meet you, John.	Nice to meet you.
Sir, let those laugh that win.	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.	This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
It is a nice piece of writing.	"""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"
He treats you okay?	Okay.
I could be gone for years.	I know.
I'm tired of this.	Almost through.
And they grow out of our stomachs?	It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.	Aren't you tired?
Where's Matt?	Matt?
Well?	I regret it is not too familiar.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!	Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Okay, but...	I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.	That's what soldiers do, right?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
"Oh, I'm not finished.  ""When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple.""  As I said. Hmm."	Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
I know who you are.	Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
You're the best?	When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Elaine, what's going on?	Ted, there's no time to explain.
Armed?	They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Sing it to me.	"""All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live.""  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves."
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.	Connie...
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.	Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You want my advice?	Oh, yes, please.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.	Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?	He's at a board meeting.
We're just not a very musical nation...	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
I'm sorry, Bill.	Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?	I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.	Which is?
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.	But Sacha always puts out that light --
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.	I just don't like it.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.	No. I said Dunbar.
I just upped my price	What?
What are you coming here to do?	I'm here for movies.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.	Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
No, Owen.	Is that a raincoat?
It had an alarm.	Yeah, I heard that.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?	Hey, do I know you?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.	Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Worse than Warsaw.	Nobody remembers that.
You know Chastity?	I believe we share an art instructor
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?	Yeah, I guess.
They go. John. They go.	What's wrong?
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.	Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
Yeah.	Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!	We've been waiting fifteen minutes
And he doesn't care about me?	He is only curious to know who you are.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!	No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?	Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
No thanks.	No thanks. What does that mean?
What do you want?	I want to speak with you.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...	If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Stop that ma'am crap!	Sorry!
The land is there.  I know it!	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Three quarters of an hour.	Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.	But he killed these guys.
Dude, this is all I got.	Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Good coloring.	That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
How is that?	Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.	Oh yeah, why?
Easy enough for you.	I never killed anyone.
I swear.	And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
What's with Mike?	He got a little jealous.
When might that be?	Day after tomorrow.
We're in?	The cheese...
Not even for emergencies?	No.
Thank you. I try.	We all try. You succeed.
Is that why you say it's horrible?	Yes.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.	Bonanza Jellybean?
What are they?	It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
What are you doing?	Pouring it out!
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?	Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Cannon or Gatling?	Both would be nice.
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
You're going to have a bachelor party?	Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
There isn't any us.	Yes there is.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.	So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?	Yes, of course.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!	Good-bye!
I love you, Elaine.	I love you.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.	What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I guess we'll need another locker.	No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Okay.	And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.	Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!	Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.	Really?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?	If I go.
"Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or ""nori"" if you prefer. I love sushi."	I love Lucy!
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?	My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Yeah?	I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Still, it must be kinda rough.	It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
Sleeping.	You remember Margie Fogg?
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.	"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...	What the fuck are you.. ?
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.	I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
I-I c-can't...	Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.	I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
So what are you gonna do about it?	Something.
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!	Sir, yes, sir!
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?	He had fish, too.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.	Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Machine.	If it's not him, there's no deal.
You real down?	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Stop.	They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.	What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...	But I... I need those books.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.	I'm on a break.
I like you.	I like you too.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?	I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Yes, I come.	I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
...nine seconds...	...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I'm sorry.	This is embarrassing.
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.	You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?	No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Little bit.	Let's go talk to Bill...
Better than what you give.	Rose... please...
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.	Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?	Right.
The winning side would have paid you much better.	Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Because my mom gets the bill.	She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Remember me?	Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.	You didn't...
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.	You must believe me.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.	How you sound?
No.	The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
I think I recognize you.	How?
For you, Mrs. Peel.	Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
You stay with me...	No way...
Hello, again.	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.	That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
My, my...	Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...
You could be quiet.	Hi.
In Mr. Sampson's office.	Now don't you worry about it.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?	If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.	Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Where are they?	I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?	I don't know.
"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."	He's telling the truth up to a point...
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?	We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Father...	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Just a little something of my own.	Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Who's that?	Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?	Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
A river pirate.	Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!	What?
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?	The wind blows... the fire burns...
Yes ma'am.	I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Well, I should probably get going.	No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.	Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?	Five, maybe six.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.	But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.	Why should WE care?
I was well compensated.	That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.	What a stupid idea.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.	Huh?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.	Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.	Jack, are you really dead?
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?	Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.	No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
Me?	Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.	Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.	Watch me.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...	What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't?	Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.	Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?	Yes.
You still should've moved.	I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
I'm really sorry!	What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.	But not now.
Yeah.	What's he doing here?
It's obviously an aborticide.	Obviously.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.	Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.	"""Make"" him?"
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --	You think we're going to be chased?
Then it's malaria?	It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.	No police!!!  No police!!
Hi... what's going on here?	Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Who are you?	I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
San Francisco.  And you?	As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
All back East.	The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
We got a problem here, brother?	Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?	It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.	What about the zoo?
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.	I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.	Making Hutch David Soul?
He's a nigger.	"Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, ""Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys..."
Listen to me good, Evan...	I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.	You better not have too much joy.
Yeah.	Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.	Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?	Yes, Courtney?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.	No, I don't.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.	No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
What makes you think he'll do it?	He seems like he thrives on danger
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?	Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?	Uh, my watch stopped.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.	I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Did you?	Talk about work? Never!
Hey, Sketchy--	We gotta talk.
Just leave her alone.	I'm so sorry.
And I congratulate you.	What for?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?	I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.	So Dorsey can get the girl?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...	I'm touched.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.	I guess so.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...	Anything ---
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.	That's okay, ROK.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.	No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
I have no idea.	Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Where'd you get the blood?	What blood?
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.	About Freddy?
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.	You mean, while I'm here.
Lauren's not my wife.	Girlfriend?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?	Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
This is him.	I remember you.
What? Come on. Is it serious?	I don't know.
Where's Mandalay?	Burma!
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.	The Institute ... the funding ...
What?!	An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?	And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Oh, thanks.	Go ahead, Ricky.
He said 'Jack'.	That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.	Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.	How is that?
You said something about money.	Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.	I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
No it's not!	Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
What 're you talking about?	She's partial to Joey, not me
A fog bank.	More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.	Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?	Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.	Like a spear.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?	You think that's really any of your business?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.	But you had so much *responsibility*.
No.  I got a problem.	Let's hear it.
Ilsa, I --	-- Yes?
Oh, won't you reconsider...	Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
Oh these moments do try me...	Be gentle.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.	Pris?
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.	Siwash, huh?
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.	"What about ""60 Minutes."""
Amnesia?	Possibly. Split personality ...
You want to go talk to him?	Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --	What the hell are you talking about --
Did -- did you --	It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Yes dear?	I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?	Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Yes. I do.	Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...	Come on, gal...
Why should I be?	For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Your lord.	"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""
What?	You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.	Why?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?	Justine was not an unwilling participant.
I'm stayin', Homer.	Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.	Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.	Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Are you following me?	I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Or have perfect table manners.	You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.	You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Good morning, Helen.	Good morning.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.	But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?	And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
What do you want me to say?	Just be natural, goddamit.
We'll figure it out.	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.	You sure?
Did you ever want to?	Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.	But you must have something to go on?
Absolutely not.	No pictures, either.
We have clearance, Clarence.	Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.	My office.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?	I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'	A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
He has thousands of employees, Milo --	It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.	South African women are very sporty.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!	Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?	Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
No one else knows	You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?	Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
What's it worth to you?	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.	I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.	There seems to be no secret about that.
Excuse me?	The fax machines.
"And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""	Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...	Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.	I don't understand.
Look Jeffrey.	Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.	Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
What is it?	It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?	Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.	A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...	Very good, Steed ...
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?	Probably not. No. Why?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.	It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.	"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?	Yes, sir.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.	This one will.
Eddie, are you okay?	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?	It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Yes.	And here are my mother and father.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.	You never learned how to speak my language.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!	Why?... Why would you need me?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.	Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?	Yes, I know.
Sea bass.	Right.
Energy shielding positive function.	Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Is this because of the radiation?	What?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.	I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Elaine.	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
We got a lot to talk about.	Yeah, old times.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?	That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
He thinks this is some kind of game!	I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
You told it to me.	Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.	What?!
Then get out!	Mark!
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.	I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.	When do we arrive at Clavius?
That tip not work-out for you fellas?	Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.	Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.	Eerie. Really eerie.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.	Good for you.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.	You killed them.
...too late, maybe around...	...perfect...
Celebrity Films.	Eddie.
What?	You heard me. Where is it?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.	Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Also identical?	Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.	Why was he missing for twenty days?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Good night, papa.	Good night, my little darling.
Hearsay.	I know the porn career's a lie.
How many people were in your old school?	Thirty-two.
Yeah? What about Laura --	That was never proved.
Why four? And not three or five?	It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Cool?	You all right?  You okay?
The Partridge Family?	I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?	What for?
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
I know it's not.	You don't even know his name.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.	Yes.
No, but he was on the moors.	It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.	-- What were they doing there?
What do you want?	We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
"Good! Do you know how we say ""make love""?"	Uh...
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...	"Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you."
"""I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."""	His father's dead, right?
You talked to Jack?	Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...	To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Good morning.	Where are you bound for?
Wisconsin.	All right, then.
No. I'm all alone.	Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
You get that off the screen?	Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.	Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
"It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: ""Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."	Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...	Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Still smells fishy.	Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?	No.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...	I know all this.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.	Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.	Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
I told you, I don't know.	I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --	-- not yet --
I can't, it's yours.	Take it. damn it!
Him.	You sure?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?	Your hairline looks like it's receding.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.	Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
The little cow is insane --	Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Who?	You know who.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.	You sing and dance?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.	Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.	I'm likin' you guys better
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.	Who else can give me information about you?
"Excellent! Now, say... ""Hello"""	Hello...
Now, how are we gonna do this?	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Will we always leave it at this?	Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!	If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.	Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
What's an immigrant?	Someone not from Maine.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--	Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Thank you.	Don't be late.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.	Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Do you have to do that?	Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.	What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.	Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
This is my new friend...	I'm Adam Webber.
The guy is fucking insane.	I warned you, Dignan.
Thank you VERY much indeed.	Now stop it!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.	Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I understand.	And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
Shut up.	Fair enough.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.	That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?	What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
And after that?	I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.	I don't think so.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.	Do you think they'll go along with us?
Pretty much.	In over your head?
I'd feel better if we had some heat.	Maybe we should bail?
An unholy trinity ...	You killed my husband.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.	Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
It's okay.	You look beautiful.
Oh, you remember now --	I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE	Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!	You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.	Yes.
Does he always leave so early?	Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Nothing out there but ocean.	Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
I'm off. I need to sleep.	Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.	For a while.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.	Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Dakota.	Ohio...
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.	I would like to have died in peace...
You wanted to get the truth.	No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Yeah.	I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.	Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Did you talk to him?	He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
"He's had his share of ""smacks"", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man."	Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
Is that him?	Wait a second.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!	Do you love her?
Oh, and Austin...	Yes?
Hello, Tom.	You here again? What do you want?
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...	There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --	I can't just walk away!
No.	Not at all?
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.	No.
And the result satisfies.	Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
...then what about...	...too late, maybe around...
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
"Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!"	I have a family, Mary.
These *credentials* are against the law!	We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
...Hello?	You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Interesting theory.	What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.	You're right. You're right.
And it is my pleasure to be here.	Really!
I think I may just go on to the reservation.	Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
It wasn't like that.	Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.	Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Dickhead?	A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I'm sure you would.	My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Bob, that makes no sense.	Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
What did you say?	Show me.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.	Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Good.	He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
You do me too much honour, Sire.	Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
You did? A human ear?	Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.	I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.	And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..	Leeloo..
Gambling's not about money.	Really?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.	That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!	Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .	She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!	Shall I leave, M'lord?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!	Well you started it.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.	Nice car.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.	That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Okay.	Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
So what's unique?	Not what.  Who.
Shut up. I'm not listening.	You don't want to talk about it.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.	I know. I was there when she arrived.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?	That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.	What should I say?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?	I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.	They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.	No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
30 seconds...	Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.	You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I want to go home.	Okay, let's go home, then.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?	No. Bob did.
That was way easier than I thought.	Aye.
Yes.	Won't be a moment.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!	You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!	He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?	I don't know. You tell me.
"Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, ""Come and get it,"" bitch!"	"Oh, I'll ""get it."" I'll ""get it"" all right. I might even take seconds."
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.	Want to know what I think happened?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?	Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
I hate her!	We all do. Now let's go.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?	No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.	Mom.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?	Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?	You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...	Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You could help us.	I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.	That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
That was in style a couple years back, man.	Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?	Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
No!	Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Yeah.	She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Marion. It's a book.	Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.	You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
No.	Thank-Q!
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.	It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.	I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.	That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.	Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
I can't do that, Bob.	Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.	I assume full responsibility.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.	I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.	That's not crazy. I like you too.
The king can do to wrong!	King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
Well...not for another two hours.	You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Loretta, never have kids.	Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
What? On one hearing only?	I think so, Sire, yes.
I stick my neck out for nobody.	A wise foreign policy.
Oh, yes.	Strange!
Just one year.	Who was your teacher?
"Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead."	That's terrible.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?	Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.	Oooh! That has the earmarks!
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.	The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.	Larry, you and your wife got problems?
What do you think?	I think I should have joined the Air Force!
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.	Can't do that now, though, can you?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.	You think I'm up for it?
Here's to Ben.	Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
OK, Bob.	It's true, Dignan.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?	Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
That's right.	Can we dream?
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.	I forgive you.
Come on, you're prettier than that.	Thanks, Patrick.
Three, four years.	What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Thank you.	Oh, and Austin...
Yeah.	And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
A lot of people like our singing.	I'm sure it's lovely.
Give me a break, would you?	If you give me one.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?	Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
She kissed me.	Where?
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.	What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
So, you surviving without me?	There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?	I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
Takin' a bath.	Any I.D.?
Yes.	I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.	Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Is Callie still around?	No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.	And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.	Like Ozzy.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.	This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Yours?	You take it. I don't know.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.	It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
To explode, of course.	And you can only do it once, right?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.	A river pirate.
How long would you need me?	Two weeks.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.	Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.	At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Good call.	So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Don't do this my son.	Open it!
This by this...	Dope?
I don't get involved with guns.	I'll make it worth your while.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.	Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Ah.	Louder.
She's a programmer?	Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?	I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
We could move 'em up here.	He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
WHAT?	I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
You're mad.	Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Yeah.	Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
I'm not wearing his pants.	Why not? He has great pants.
How?	Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
How I make my living, what's your point?	This.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.	You just drove by it.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
They?	Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
Yes, your name?	He, I'm Mona.
Not really.	Is there something we can do?
Has he been refusing food?	Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.	Like fish.
Oh Jesus!	LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.	Suppose we do.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.	But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Let go of me!	Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
How is that possible?	Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
No	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
I want to go talk to him.	What...?  Why?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.	Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.	He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Hmmm?	Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.	Patrick, you re a lunatic.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.	Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
This came for you, sweetie.	Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.	It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
-- it's just him? --	-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
What are you talkin' about?	You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?	That I am very little different from him.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!	Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
We're here brother.	You gotta keep going.
You think he got my license plates?	He looked too shaken-up.
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't...
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.	What'chu sayin'?
Jesus.	Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
You do?	I mean, it's your life.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.	Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Were you and my father having an affair?	Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.	Are they?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.	Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
It's your fantasy...	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Yes.	Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?	You can believe that if you want to.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?	Thirty-eight...simulated.
Thanks for the information.	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.	In the room?
Hardy, what are you doing --	Isn't this how your story goes?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --	-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
When did we get it from them?	1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.	Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Mr. Dickson in yet?	Not yet, Mr. Clark.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?	Right.
Ask me?	"Yes. He said, ""Ask your wife."" I don't know why he said that."
Why they gotta make my nose so big?	Look at my lips.
I thought about that.	She must've fallen asleep at the table...
How many people go here?	Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?	And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.	Why two?
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...	Save your breath for the climb.
Hey, how are you?	Hungry.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.	Whatever... stella.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.	Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.	True.
If God exists?	I think now that he might...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.	Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.	Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Hello?	Mr. Thomerson.
Book the good ones for where?	Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.	I'm on my way.
And his baggage?	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
Did you order our houses burned down?	Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.	Do you hear him? Do you?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.	Why? What for?
Ever been to Club Skunk?	Yeah.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?	Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
De-la-croix.	Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?	I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"...that filth is better left in the ""Sin Cities."""	A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Exactly.	But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?	Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.	That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.	Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.	Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Nothing. Are you alright?	Sure I'm alright.
The name of the show?	It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Do you always drive this fast?	Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Didn't know you was workin' here now?	I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?	I don't want him.
This time we'll make an exception.	Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.	That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.	No costume.  No blackface.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.	No.
Here we go.	Great.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!	I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.	You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.	Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.	I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Would you excuse me?	Sure.
Hey.	Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Good woman.  I trained her right.	Daddy, she's younger than me.
Yes?	I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.	You are bound by an oath, Father.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?	Soon.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?	No. You sure you're okay?
Get out of the way.	No, Dignan. This isn't --
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.	Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.	By myself?
Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.
Lily... Jesus Christ...	After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.	Then why?
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.	Come where?
Yes, sir.	You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?
I'm Adam Webber.	He's really funny!
He suggested I ask you.	Ask me?
We don't chat.	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.	Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Good. Or should I speak slower?	Yes.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.	O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Mary...	Yes?
And what about Big Al?	Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
You're late again, Rick.	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...	You sure that's the reason?
"Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your ""Physical Fitness"" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies."	No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
You promise?	Yeah.  I promise.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?	He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
This isn't the time --	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What're you implying.	Nothing!
What?	A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
But you don't realize....	Goodbye, Aud...
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?	Who said I...wait, what?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.	So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.	Why weren't you at the platform?
Will I get to work for Outpost?	No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
You're learning.	Where does he sell it?
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Looks like he's been detained.	Who's going? Us?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Let's grab some food.	First decent idea you've had.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?	There was no ad in the Times.
The human?	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
What mission?	To save the world.
Oh, yeah.	You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
You know who The Raincoats are?	Why, don't you?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.	Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You got any money?	Thought you had a man for that.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?	No, not at all.
What dead? Who is dead?	A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Come on, go on...	It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.	These aren't just...
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.	I'm hungry.
There are only two other alternatives for him.	What are they?
Shut up!	What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?	Yes, Doctor.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.	Snuff films.
This man -- did you see him?	No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
I'll do it.	No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.	Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't believe it!	I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
In over your head?	Pretty much.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?	I swear.
Nice neighborhood.	Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.	Your address?
What?!	You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What?	Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.	Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
How was it?	Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.	But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
I'm in position, Scarecrow.	Any activity?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.	It's more than that.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?	I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Oh. Yeah.	You've been coming in early.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.	Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
I remember.	This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...	Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
I don't know the finish yet.	Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I don't want you to let go.	Maybe I won't.
Okay. Yeah. What time?	Eight?
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.	What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.	There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.	Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.	I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""	I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
In so many words, yes.	Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.	Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
No, ma'am.	Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Oh, get it over with.	I don't suppose... no...
You sure?	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.	What happened, Doolittle?
They're *outrageous*, them rules!	Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -	Yes?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.	You're selling dad's boat?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.	Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.	So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No thanks. What does that mean?	I don't want to go.
I want more life, fucker.	Come here.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.	I guess I'll never know, will I?
Okay. She's fine.	You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.	Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
You win.	Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
A bit.	Me, too.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?	I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.	That was very well put, Ted.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?	Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!	I didn't come here to be insulted.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?	Stand by. One.
Wait! Wait!	What?
Oh! Great. That's great!	A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Of course!  Uh, sir?	What?
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!	Sorry.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?	Not right now.
...You got my E-mail?	And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You should stay.	I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.	You're a weasel.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!	Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.	Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.	David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
So, what do we do now?	That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Well...	You want to kiss me...
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.	He has a computer?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?	No, I think a whiskey.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?	Yep, you guessed it.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.	Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.	That seems very unlikely.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.	True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?	I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.	You were not.
Halfdan the Black.	But, Erik...
I know.	It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.
Fix?	I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.	Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?	That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.	You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?	Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Krueger is reality.	And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!	David, don't lose control.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.	What are you talkin' about?
Must get lonely being up here so much.	I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.	You just said
As per mother's instructions.	Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?	Yeah.
...Not far, now.	Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.	Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Yes sir. Negative effect.	What was that, Doolittle?
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...	-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
This is all that survived?	Actually only one cell survived..
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?	Yes.
Shut it up, Loretta.	Oh, Christ, it's true.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!	No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
What is it?	May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
We was coming to see you.	If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Thank you.	Want to try it again?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.	What friend?
I'd like to talk to you about something.	Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.	Good to know you, John.
Bye, Leif.	Bye... sorry...
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
What about his teeth?	You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Let's go!  Let's go!	Fuckin' A!
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?	A Chigro?
-- not yet --	-- it's just him? --
Who's Camille?	None of your business.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.	She doesn't need to know.
"Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my ""great second chance"", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --"	But you will.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.	Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.	They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	Always has been.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.	We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?	Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.	Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Uh... Are you a giraffe?	Yes.
It's real.	Nothing out there but ocean.
And they are?	I want to watch you work.
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!	Sir, yes, sir!
What is it?	Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.	I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.	We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.	Oh it does???
Now let's have a drink.	Right here in church?
That's a fantastic idea --	See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Ground defense.	Did you hear that?
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?
I want to watch you work.	I'll consider it.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.	Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
What's wrong with him?	Must be the pressure.
What do you want with us?	Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.	Oh, okay, can I call?
What?	When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!	I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
Five.  On credit.	This ain't a credit business.
What do you want, Stan?	Can I... I brought some --
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon	Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?	Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.	What?!
You're kidding.	Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
Sit down!	This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.	I can't do that.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...	I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?	Neither!
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?	You got in the car, didn't you?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I'm on duty.	So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.	No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
What was her name?	What's your name?
You've killed your fair share of men.	If I could go back to farming --
What about it?	It's a five-pointed star.
"So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say ""no"" without ever using the word."	Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
What did she look like?	Well, she... uh...
And you have this letter of intent?	Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
Well, not me personally.	On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Nick, we can't just --	I said let's go, Charlie.
Thanks.	And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Is it true?	Do you believe it?
What do you see?	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.	Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
No wire.	Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.	Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
I'm not nuts.	Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.	Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.	Well, in that case...of course, son.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.	Not a prayer.
Who's this?	Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...	The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!	She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
What is Debbie's position?	Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Uh-huh.	He tapped that.
You okay?	Yeah...
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.	Excuse me. I really must he going.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?	Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Grifters...	We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.	Commissioner.
How much are they paying you to be here?	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Something wrong with the stairs?	Avoid-all-contact-day.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.	She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
The bottom falls out of the sword business!	It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
What are you doing, Herr Director?	Taking out what you should never have put in.
What was that?	Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and	All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
"You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about ""the Lord works in mysterious ways?"""	Straight up.
"You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even ""hello,"" you accuse me... ?"	I'm not accusing you...
Aye.	How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No.	"Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes ""TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"""
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?	Small talk.  Try the weather.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.	Good morning.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.	You know where I'm from?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.	I did.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.	I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Which one is your brother?	The big one.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.	Right.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.	Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Something like that.	What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
She was there...	Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.	Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
That's what everybody believes?	Yes, sir. It's true.
I did.	No, you didn't!
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?	We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
I think about girls a lot.	I asked you about school.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.	The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.	No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Where did he go?	Who? Applejack?
Lydia.	And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Oh, Amber...	I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
No, I guess not.	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Mom?	Yes?
"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""	Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Ballet? What ballet?	Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
What the fuck are you.. ?	You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
Dope?	Not in that company.
No good options left?	In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
I thought you were a December baby.	This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.	Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?	You don't have squat.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.	It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Extra money, huh?	Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Let's go talk first, Adam.	Yes, ma'am.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --	You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.	I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?	Yes.
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!	Where is the key?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?	My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
All right.  Here.	What...?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!	I know.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?	Yes -- I believe you do.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!	Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Mine too?	Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
Ten percent.	You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...	Who?
What?	I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
What's the matter with my place?	No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Rosalie, you okay?	What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Yes.	It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?	You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.	What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."	We?  You've taken it?
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...	Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Firefly must be captured at any cost.	That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.	Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Anybody see ya?	Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Masters of our own destiny.	So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
You didn't have to do this.	Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --	Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
What the fuck are you doing?	Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.	Sir?
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.	I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Here?	Now. Show now.
Why was he missing for twenty days?	Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?	Skywire.
What about your family, Donnie?	No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?	What does Charlie mean?
I don't know.	Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.	I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
It's not mine either.	It's what you came back for.
He fell.  He falls.	He must have taken quite a fall.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!	What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.	No.  They all do.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...	Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.	He could?
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.	Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Young Robert, we are honored --	My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?	She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
What's that noise?	The locks.
The big one!	It does?
You're living here?	'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?	Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!	All right.
It is miraculous.	Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...	Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.	Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.	That's it.
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!	No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
Here?	Do it!
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.	Kayleigh? What happened?
Jesse, is that your hand?	Nuh-huh ...
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --	Stop.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
I was expecting someone else.	Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
They must have turned him down.	Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Stop talking.	You got absolute zero.
What do you want?	Conklin.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.	Patrick, we need to focus.
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --	Well - what is he now?
Back up.	Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.	You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!	Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?	For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Grounded for the rest of the year?	You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?	How do I stop one?
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.	Courtney? Dinner?
Liberating isn't it?	Y'know it is, a bit.
You're wasting your time.	Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?	Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
David.	You're not having a good time are you?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.	Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
What is that?	Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.	You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
See anything?	No.
The zoo?	Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Wicked.	No more fuckin' for her.
I don't know.	Well, ask her!
If not you, then who?	Mueller.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?	Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
I'd like to buy you a drink.	Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
No one else heard it?	He whispered it in my ear.
"What? Did the politburo just one day say - ""We give up?"""	Yes. That's kind of how it was.
It came my way. 450 a week.	450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.	I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
A dressing bag.	Very smart indeed.
Have we met?	You mean you don't recall??
Tower, here.	This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
I have come to commission work from you.	What work?
Hello.	This is Cheeba.
"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"	No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?	Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Right. Wait. A toast.	You're just afraid to eat it.
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --	Guilty until proven innocent?
I can imagine.	Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
How does she like what in bed?	Like what?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.	This pageant's like a roach motel.
It looks delicious.	You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
What?	Where is Jesse James?
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.	Elaine, we have to go back.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --	-- automatic channels open --
Yeah.	A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Because I like to torture you.	Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
What happened?	Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
You got something on your mind?	I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Not yet. Not married.	Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Why -- why -- of course.	You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
You may.	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Oh?  So you are a new man?	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?	Well, yes, I admit it is.
Happy now?	No.
How do you want to pay?	Cash.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.	What medicine?
What?	I said I don't have any.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.	I want to yank Kobo.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?	Then who --
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.	Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.	What else do you need?
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.	The Scots will fight for us?
He's coming?	You better go.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --	A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.	Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.	What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.	The fuck you been doin' to me?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?	Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?	Yes.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.	That's nice.
That's stupid.	Why? People fart backwards.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?	Scraps.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...	I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
Fine. We hit this bank.	You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
You mean not enough to save you.	JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...	Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --	-- Don't tell me where you're going.
When?	Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?	Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.	You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.	Easy come, easy go.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.	What's the matter with you?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!	Yes, you do!
Look, the sky is blue...	The sun! That's it!
Excuse me? What's your name, son?	Gerald.
The night before the shooting.	How was she?
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?	What do I do?
You're crazy.	I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.	So how does it happen?
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Is this really happening?	I'm sorry.
He's got piano lessons.	Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Jim, you been with a girl yet?	Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
How different?	Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
What the fuck!	The paint!
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.	Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
You don't look thirty-five.	How old do I look?
I do not seek forgiveness.	My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Take your second position.	OK. Roger.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.	Leave.  Now.
I just don't want to go over it any more.	I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.	In English, Pinkerton.
But you didn't see it, right?	Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?	There were more than that.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?	He's pretty tight with his family.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.	Why didn't his niece slap your face?
I'm just leaving.	But where?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?	Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.	I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry."	What?
I'm sure they're around.	Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I'm serious here.	So am I.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.	Like it never happened...
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?	He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?	Okay.
What?	He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Yes ... ?	... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Bring it to the other location.	But you said the other --
Scarecrow?	Yeah?
Looting and pillaging, eh?	Yes.
All right, then.	The bitch.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --	What?!
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.	Yeah.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.	Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
He is a cute thing.	He's your cute thing.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.	Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.	She tells you how I've been--
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.	Who?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --	-- I should tear your head off.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?	Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Smells like sex in here.	Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.	True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.	But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?	If he can do it, yes.
I hope Ilene's all right.	I hope those guys are all right.
More romances for John?	Hmmm?
Where you been?	Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.	Mob?
Of course it's true - and he knows it.	Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.	You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Who?	Detective Donald KIMBALL?
No, it was lovely.	Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!	I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Hi.	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.	I'll take some.
You're political, then?	"No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. ""Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."""
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?	Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.	Well, actually
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.	I was talking to the cat.
In the generator room again?	Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
That's what it says.	How did you manage it?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.	But there's no more drug.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.	Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?	No, she's fine.
Like this.	Okay. Okay.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.	And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Is there a part for me?	No.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.	And I didn't have an argument.
No more fuckin' for her.	Smurfette doesn't fuck.
"I believe your next line is ""What are you trying to hide?"""	Well?
I'll tell you what...	Yes?
You love her that much?	Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Swell!	Your friend was to remain where he was!
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.	What the fuck are you talking about?
Why, Matt!	What are you doing here?
She up for this?	She's up for it.
Good night, my little darling.	Papa?
Have you had any before?	No.
I'm fine.	Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Tell everybody hey.	You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Do you have a daughter?	I'm afraid not.
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!	I still like UPSTART the best.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.	Reynolds? You've done your research.
How do you know?	I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?	You smell like formaldehyde.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.	Hardly.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.	My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.	I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...	You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?"	Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Then start taking them seriously.	Yes, ma'am.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.	I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --	I don't think I want to hear this --
Let's not even talk about it.	It was stupid.
Something bugging you?	Yeah. A few things.
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
My baby!	What, you named it already?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!	That's it...
Why didn't his niece slap your face?	She did.
And...	And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.	But did you know him?
Dunbar.	Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?	Yes, Monsieur.
Adult Bookstore.  Why?	Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?	Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.	Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?	Yes!
Call me David.	Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Hey, what are you doing here?	Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.	I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--	No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!	You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Winning isn't everything.	Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You've lost your mind.	We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Give it back.	Try and take it.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.	But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
So.	So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
What?	Wisconsin.
What?	The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Oh! Gave me a start.	I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.	Whooee!
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?	It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
After six.	Negative. Cancel it.
Lemme put some clothes on.	No time.
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.
Did he say a wolf?	Yes, I believe he did.
Tell me about it, please!	It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
I'll take you up on that.	Goodnight.
What?	This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...	'Our revels now are ended.'
I want you to hurt me.	No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
It was staged?	Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Where's your gun?	Chest pocket.  Shit!
Yeah?	Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Patrick Bateman's office.	Jean? Hello? Jean?
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.	Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
What are you gonna do?	Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?	It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.	Oh! Great. That's great!
Nope.	You're going to be over the limit.
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
I worry when you get like this.	It's just a nightmare.
Like a spear.	Beg pardon?
Tired...	That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.	"""Fifteen minutes of fame?"" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either."
Lucky, I guess.	That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!	Calm down, please.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
This all you want?	Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.	I told him that you all is sick.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?	I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...	What one?
-- Burn them.	And the world -- the whole world.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.	Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
But what about us?	We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?	Yes sir. Negative effect.
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.	If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Thanks.	Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.	Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.	I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?	Yes, and on 'dictis'.
I'll have to find some more.	Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Bang!	You and me.
Gary?	Just do it.
Simon, what's happening?!	He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.	He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
No.	Yes.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.	Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Something about my father?	Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.	I was on call.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.	It must be done right away.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.	So did we. Why didn't you come?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.	Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
No I don't.	In the world.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.	A little bit of both.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!	Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?	I think so.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.	Any clue as to what it is?
Okay.	Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.	Joel, you're a liar.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.	You could make your own cinnamon toast.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.	"What happened to ""degrees""?"
Pecos Bill.	Heathcliffe.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?	Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Is there anything that can stop it?	Yes..thank God..
So, did you buy a movie?	What?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?	I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!	I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Hi.	We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
I didn't know we had sailboats.	It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
That's right -- premature ejection.	What will happen to him, Ted?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.	"I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.	Of course.
The families who control the casinos?	Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
How many months are you?	Two.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.	Really?
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.	Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.	I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
Yes?	I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.	How could you?! This is just like home!
Bullshit.	Look in my pack.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...	I want a job, Giles.
He went back for his brother.	We said 48 hours.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-	Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...	They?
It's got to be stopped!	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.	We tried!
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...	A little what?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?	I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.	That sounds like Dignan.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?	I worry when you get like this.
Whom did they choose?	Herr Sommer.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.	Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
Mother, is that you?	Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.	I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!	Gerade aus dann links!
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.	Departmental policy.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.	What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Take it off.	Why?
Extremely clever.	Meaning you didn't like it.
About - thirty-four seconds.	We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
Was that your sister?	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Have you got a license?	No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!	Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?	What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.	What's the matter?
Why's his britches round his knees?	R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.	It was staged?
What's suck night?	That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...	What did she want?
And we got rid of the red head.	Jake? Customs?
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.	I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.	Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Thank Christ for that.	You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Tell me.	Chub says you're fired.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.	This is no game.
You getting cold feet?	I'm in till the end.
"This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an ""investment.""  These are stock ""certificates"" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable."	They're pretty.  Can I have them?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.	I bet you did lots of bad things.
You must leave?	Yeah...
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?	What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
What's that?	I'm taking a piss.
Peace is made is such ways.	SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Let me think about it.	There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
No.	You don't?
So, we call them... IMGs.	Infant Memory Generators.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?	Nah, I don't know.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.	Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
I don't see anything!	Just look!!
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.	I've never been given a fair shot.
Nobody saw you bring her in?	There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.	I thought as much.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.	All right.  Here.
What was that, I didn't hear...	It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
What do you do?	I'm a revolutionary.
Yes, sir, I am.	Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?	Hey, what kind of talk is that?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.	Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
I don't know.	Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
Wanna walk me home?	Sure.
What?	That's what it's about.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.	For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.	You don't say. How real does it feel?
who can I say is calling?	This is the President.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.	No... two.
Hi, it's me...	Fuck you.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?	I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.	At least you were never lonely.
You just say. I'm not really --	I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Well, yes.	Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
You want to dance?	Okay.
Valentine, listen to me ...	Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.	Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?	I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.	Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
What are you doing here?	I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.	Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
I said welcome.	WELCOME?
Huh?	The night before the shooting.
What do you mean?	I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.	It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Yeah, I heard that.	Five, seven, eight dollars.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.	How do you do, sir?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?	What?
You've all sworn to Longshanks.	An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I'm not kidding.	What'd he get?
I don't suppose... no...	What?
What??	I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
I didn't shoot West...	What?
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.	I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
What?	There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.	I never do...
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?	It's pretty.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	A few things came up.  Or went down.
Trying.	Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
You haven't eaten your lunch.	I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.	Why's that?
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?	Not to mention on me.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?	Sure.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!	Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
She got me thinking...	So? What'd you do to her?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?	It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.	Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
You knew Sergeant West?	He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?	It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Yes.	Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Why?	I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Who is it?	A friend of your fiance's.
You need some weed?	Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Been here long?	Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.	Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.	Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.	Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Yeah.	It's so small.
You're living on a sailboat?	It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?	Do you think she's prettier than I?
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.	"I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"
Just do it.	Atta-go.
This is nicer than your other apartment.	It's not that nice.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?	But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
No more water, you said.	Take it.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.	It must be great.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Jake --	What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
I looked.	Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
CONTINUED	Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
How old are you?	Twenty-five.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.	Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.	Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
So what's up with you?	I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.	Shhhh...it's okay.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.	Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Okay. Thank you.	Whatever.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!	Don't give me that fucking shit.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.	A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Then don't have a drink.	Boss, let's get out of here.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.	You know who The Raincoats are?
I don't buy or sell human beings.	That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Where is escort service?	That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
They told me I was too old to serve.	They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Where you going?	I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.	I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.	What?
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
"That doesn't sound right...  take out ""President""...  now read it."	"""My dear""..."
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!	You know exactly where they are!
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.	Fuck them.
What?	Switch! You drive!
He wouldn't kill anybody...	Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Other way around, sir.	Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Really?	Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Perfect, Cole.	Let's ride.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.	You've been married twice --
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.	You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Where you boys going?	There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?	Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Tell me what he said.	He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Never heard of it.	That's not gonna fly.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.	Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
That's all there is.	Believe me I know.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...	Yeah, Jimmy?
What?	You look beautiful like that.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.	Oh, we're good man.
Hey.	Hey.
That don't do us any good.	But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
You gonna steal my truck?	Make yourself at home. You done it already.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.	Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
We're lost!	The land is there.  I know it!
That's ridiculous.	Maybe. But that's how it works.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.	Really?
Oooooh, I'm good.	Hey, you guys back already?
Yes, I like you.	You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Are you a fag?	You're the faggot.
Then do it.	Fine, I will.
Where are the women?	They should be here any minute.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --	Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.	German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Both pilots!	Can you fly this airplane and land it?
What can I be doing for you?	You're a pimp?
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...	I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
He was a modest man.	It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?	Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.	He needs me, ma'am.
That's because it's such a nice one.	Forget French.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...	Guess people ought to know who I am...
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?	No.  That's stupid.
You've found missing persons before.	Nothing remotely like this.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?	I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.	Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
You tell me.	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Take a seat -- you're next.	Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
What are there character traits?	Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
What night?	I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Hold on --	Here we go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?	Alright.
No?	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I was making a point.	What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
No, before my time.	You don't read, do you?
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?	No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Wow. Did he go to jail?	He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Dad!	Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Yes.	See my breasts? See?
Getting very weird.	I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.	Jesus.
Uh-huh. Adam?	Yes, Eve?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...	Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.	What do you mean, Sire?
I have. Sit down over there.	Put that gun down.
Thank God for bunge cords.	...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Christ, it's oil of tansy!	I don't know it.
Sorry. I just --	It's just... y'know... I mean...
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.	Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.	Like what?
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.	Stand by.
Yeah. What are you doing now?	I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.	Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.	Yeah...
What are these?	Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.	Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
I loved it blond.	It's only hair. I haven't changed.
'Why' would be enough for me.	I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?	No, Owen.
Then you screwed up	How?
That's what she is!	I know that. But --
No, I want my cut!	I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.	Damn. All that reading paid off.
Nothing.	Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.	You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
I see the world.	Is it night or day, Erik?
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.	What happened?
Is your family in the apple business, too?	No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.	Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.	No, he is here.  Shit...
The Anti-Christ?	No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.	"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."
So?	Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
And your hand too.	I took the bandage off yesterday.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.	Really? What is it he's writing?
I'm telling you it's not that.	I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
They're all divorced?	Everybody's divorced.
"That's not right yet... put back ""President"" and take out ""dear""... How does it read now?"	"""My President""..."
I guess so.	Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Well? Continue! Continue!	Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
I think I may have found a way out of here.	You're kidding.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?	Again.
The one about the witch.	Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
You did this -- overnight?	You're making me young again.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.	Sorry.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?	I haven't the slightest idea.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.	Who says that? You could take credit on it.
How do I look?	You look very good.
How far from here?	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?	Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I could use a date.	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.	Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.	But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.	You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.	You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.	REALLY?
Tumescent!	You're not helping.
Do you think the police did a good job?	I don't know.  I think so.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.	Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.	Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
... and also to bring medicine.	Chief says...
I mean they want to get caught.	Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA	If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Learning language.	Which one?
It didn't work?	That's correct, sir.
Beg pardon?	You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Oh, Tangerine.	Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.	Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.	I intend to.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.	Okay.
Of what? They're both crooks.	Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Dad?	Son?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.	Loretta, never have kids.
But	"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
Come on.  Try.	Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
You never told me how your parents met.	They met at Auburn.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.	You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.	And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back.	Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
What about relatives?	All back East.
Keep going...	Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.	So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Eee Oott Auught!	Sorry. What?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.	Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.	That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.	But if they <u>do</u>?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.	You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Scale the --	Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.	And DIE!
Her temperature is a hundred and four.	How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Do you like quotes, Howard?	How do you mean?
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.	I don't think we're ready.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.	Oh Jesus.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --	Can anybody hear me!
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
All right, it's a matter of death.	Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
I'm on it	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--	Logan Cale.
Anything else?	Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
I forgive you.	Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
Well?	I'm thinking...
Are any of those right?	This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Don't look so freaked.	I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Movement!	Position?
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...	...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?	Tired...
I found her in bed with someone.	Who was he?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.	I did.
Yeah.	To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?	The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?	No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?
"...Today's ""To Do"" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the ""Physical Fitness"" number --"	Nothin' too showy!
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.	Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Meaning?	Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.	I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.	Something about my father?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Put it down as a gesture to love.	Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
"My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  ""No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!""  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!"	Uh, I think they have.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?	Aw, nerts!
People.	You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
I'm sorry, Cole.	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.	No.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.	That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I want to know about Treadstone.	To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
--a philandering pig.	But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.	Well, let's have a look.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.	That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...	It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
I guess this is a first for you.	No, I've been excited before.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.	Good for you. Come on.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...	Why should you care?
Get married. Have a wedding.	Evelyn?
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.	What?
A job for me?	I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.	You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.	Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Give me some?	I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.	Yeah?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.	Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Show me something?	Like what?
As long as you're okay.	I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Good-bye, Adam.	Goodbye.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
We know all that, Exposition.	I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?	I want to know why .
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.	Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.	We sure Big Al threw him to us?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?	Good point.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.	Yes sir.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?	In here, says he wants a million.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.	There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
But then how can you...	I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Beautiful.	Thanks.
So?	He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.	Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.	He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
You don't know where this is gonna...	I got a hairdo.
No, I mean... you love your son?	More than anything in the world.
Wait! I need those!	There is no softer ground than town.
Who?	You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
To what?	You're now Mantan.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.	Wade, are you alright?
Did he buy it?	I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.	It's a plain end, see? So?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.	So let the council swear publicly.
I'm sorry, honey.	No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.	Any tips on where these guys may be?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.	How do you do?
Rogers Hornsby?!?	He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.	Tonight then.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.	Ropes?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.	I'm sorry.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.	There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Yeah.	Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
None of your business.	This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
What medicine?	I don't know. He has pains.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...	No.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.	That was fucking deep.
You want him dead too.	After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
I would like to change your name.	To what?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.	How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.	And the carrying charges?
A toy?	She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Naomi, I guess.	Yeah.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--	Yes Basil?
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.	Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
You rat.	I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
You think I don't know that?	Milo. Why would he --
Our money situation is not good.	"You're so spoiled. What is ""not good"" to you? Only a few hundred --"
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.	You're serious.
I can't say I do. What is it?	I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.	How are you?  Having any luck?
Passion is something one cannot control!	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
So?	So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.	Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?	I was hoping you'd say that.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.	I come from a big family.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?	She's dead.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.	She's a jerk.
Get in the bathroom!	Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!	I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Go ahead.	Sandy?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.	Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Don't...	What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?	Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
From up close or far away?	His chest was hamburger --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?	Yeah.
I told you	You don't care if I die
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.	What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Yes.	Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
He is the only one unaccounted for.	Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?	Sixteen 'C', why?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...	A tortoise.  What's that?
Yes?	Which is the one - we have to worry about?
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!	You fool!
Can I feel 'em?	If you want to.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.	Well, so long.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.	My fucking heart bleeds.
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.	And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
I'm not smiling.	Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Any planets?	Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?	You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.	Cash.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.	Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.	What?
That's not the information I've received.	Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
"""Once a carnie, always a carnie."""	Oh-yah.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.	Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
I figured you share information.	We do.
Why were you snooping in my office?	Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
What do you mean?	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
You're right, sir.	Then why can't I go in there?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?	I don't remember saying yes.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.	Shit.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?	Yes please, two.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...	Neil... Neil Cole.
Ross.	Who did it? Tell me!
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.	Where are my goddamn books?
I have acted as I think fit.	Sir, I'm a British officer.
I beg your pardon?	It was a wolf.
WHY?	Yes.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.	BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."	Yes.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.	But you didn't.
Are you going to have women at your party?	No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.	I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
How's that 700 bucks coming?	I'm working on it.
My friend Jack was just here.	Your dead friend Jack?
William Harcourt?	Yes...
Which is?	There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...	Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?	Two weeks holiday.
Do we post it on the Net?	There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
What's going on down there?	Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.	What guys do.  'Nother order.
It's ten thirty in the morning.	Yeah, if you've slept.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.	What are you talking about, Bob?
Do you want to rest a bit?	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.	They're what?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?	Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
How many bodies, Greenly?	Eight.
Frank?	Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
But we took the keys?	Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
There's something else I would like you to help me with.	Name it.
How much longer is this gonna last?	You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Uh...	...Hoppi-hoppa.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.	Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Thank you.	Good luck, kid.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...	Stop it.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.	No, no. Never.
June, July ... August?	The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.	Are you hurting her?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?	What's its current position?
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.	You're a good man, Hardy.
And wear a crown and everything.	And everything.  He should be king!
You had my help, detective.	If anything happens to her while I'm here --
It's registered in my mother's name.	What the fuck possessed you?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
This is good. Who did it?	'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
You better not have too much joy.	Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Hi...	Hi.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!	Actually, I volunteered.
Sounds like a threat.	You didn't answer my question.
Is the flight full?	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
How's this about me?	They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.	...Yes, Sir.
You need to get out more.	C'mere, I want to show you something.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?	Then and now.  But not right now.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.	I'd kill it.
No chance.	He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.	I might still have a few chips left.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!	That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.	Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.	You can if you want.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?	Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
I will.	"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."
Is that Jango?	No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
Books?	My journals! Where are they?
You little sleaze bag!	...Ma???
1002.	All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.	Pretty.
Is he working?	I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...	Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
You hear that?!	Yes.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.	You're wasting your time.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.	Whose fault was that?
I do.	I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?	"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.	Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.	Ui-vol-i-tub!
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.	Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.	You've all sworn to Longshanks.
You.	Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Someone dead from this household?	We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Who is she?	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?	I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.	No. I never did, either.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.	Don't move.
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...	Tom...
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.	I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
What?	I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.	About goddamn time.
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
...Whaddo I do?	So you believe me?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?	No, it's different, honey.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.	No I don't.
Bye mom.	We was robbed.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.	Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.	Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.	No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Calvin!	Coming!
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.	Yeah.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.	What's your name?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.	God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.	Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.	Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.	No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.	You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
They're dead.	Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
Ya love it, probie?	I'm in heaven, Lt.
Where are your folks?	They left.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.	Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?	Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Uh-uh.	S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
That about sums it up.	Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
I hate having my picture taken.	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.	Sorry, I was seven at the time.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?	Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
I just had a mental picture of...	Here, pick these up!
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.	What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.	Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?	Kiss me.
I guess they're stupid.	Did you do that when you were a kid?
I couldn't resist them.	You mean I won't resist them.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.	Why not?
Where are you going?	I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
What do you mean?	Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?	You will regret this.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.	Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
What?	Tish-I'm-tee.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.	Who?
You didn't give them a name.	They know me.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.	I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.	It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
I don't own a television.	A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Wait, Erik!	Keitel Blacksmith?
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.	No, Victor, no.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?	Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.	What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.	Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
What did you think of the music?	Extremely clever.
Tempus fugit!	En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
I don't think so.	Wipe your hands.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!	You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
So now you suddenly care about my future?	Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.	Opera? Opera!
I shouldn't have come.	They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.	What?!
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.	You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Anything.	Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Milo?	My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...	Okay.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...	Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.	He killed a police officer.
Well, put it down and come in!	You bet, hon!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.	No. I just need some space, maybe.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.	You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
You got it! Wait here while I change.	Sure.
Name?	Hammond.
I'd use the word insane.	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Over the river.	Have you got transport?
No what?	No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.	Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
What do you want? An apology?	No, I want my cut!
She's very pretty, your mother.	Yes.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.	I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.	Can't I just maim it a little?
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?	I like it.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...	Where did he get all that information?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.	See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...	"They'll be more than ""hurt"" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?	Frank?
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.	What are there character traits?
Hey, sweet cheeks.	Hi, Joey.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.	Did we?
He succeeded.	We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Yes.	He came from Paris with Rick.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?	I remember him.
We missed.	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--	Austin, what's your point?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Can you protect me?	Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
"""The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."""	Twenty?!
Do you love me?	Do you love me?
Juneau.	Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.	Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?	She dropped in on me... holding this.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?	"""...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."""
I would never --	I know.
Do you have the money?	What money?
I don't want to.	Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?	Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?	Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.	So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.	I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.	Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.	Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?	Do you recognize any of them?
Hey...	Hey...
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.	I'm afraid so.
What's the hurry?	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Not now, Elaine!	Ted!
It's pretty old.	It belongs to Pop.
Open the door, will ya?	Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.	What's up?
That's a dumb thing to say.	You're right.
What else, my dear Major?	By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Frost?	Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Yes, Hicks?	Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
We're running out of time, sir.	Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Permission to come aboard, sir.	Permission granted.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?	You'll find out.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?	$50?
What the fuck are you talking about?	That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Who's now vanished.	Makes two of us.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!	It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
I'm all wet.	What's wrong with that?
Brilliant.	Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?	I'm sure.
Right.	Wrong.
I hate cheats.	All men are cheats.
Delacroix.	Yeah, him.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.	The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --	-- I work for the city.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.	All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Two hundred bucks?	You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.	Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .	Stay back!  I'm okay.
The tickets.	They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?	I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?	You had a nasty bump.
Strange.	Think they're alright?
Wolfi!	Put it down!
Just the last three weeks.	That's not a bad place to start.
I'm camera shy.	You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.	What was inside?
Why not?	It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Hey...	School's cancelled.
I just got in.	Long day thinking.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.	He has thousands of employees, Milo --
How do you figure?	Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?	It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?	If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?	She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...	Do you feel alone right now?
That wasn't our deal.	You want him dead too.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.	How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Hi.	How's it going?
Good. Then have a drink.	No. Not me, boss.
Why not?	Because there's nothing to see.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?	Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!	What?
I don't even think you have a gun!	Neither do I!
Give me the keys, Dignan.	I can't do that, Bob.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.	I'm telling you it's not.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.	Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Show me where you buried her.	I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Rose Rose has runned away!	She took off in the night!
What?	The marriage!
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.	You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
So let the council swear publicly.	We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.	Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Mind if I ride along with you?	This has nothing to do with your fire.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?	Go ahead.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...	It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
The sky!!!	The sky?  Where?
It was different...	What was she like?
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.	Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Happy Birthday.	Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Yes.	What about the raping?
Nobody move!	Get against the wall!
Tomorrow, Gordon.	Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.	Gary, don't worry, we --
Tell him I'm at lunch.	Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Get some sleep.	I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.	Roll the hose.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.	That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Excuse me?	Get out
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?	He was a modest man.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.	Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Don't say that.	It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.	He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
You all right?	Yes...
What's this?	Nothing.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?	Sure.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...	You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.	How do you know this?
No.	Good, just making sure.
Just tell me about the money.	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.	So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Still bickerin' over that, huh?	Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?	Mind your own business, Peaches.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?	Surveillance? By whom?
We do?	Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	John, how's your wife this morning?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,	Okay, but...
It wasn't a lunatic.	I beg your pardon?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer	But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
I love you, Chuck.	You too.
Could be a lot of things.	Yeah?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.	You ready?
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?	Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
You mean -- break in?	I don't know --
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.	So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -	I'd sooner swim!
What are you talking about?	The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.	I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.	What?
How did you end up here?	How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
You are a monster, Zorg!	I know...
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.	Not for long.
No. I said Dunbar.	"Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said ""Dunbar was gone,"" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie."
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.	These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
You didn't tell me you lived with her.	You know each other?
There's another stocker, right?	We know there's another stocker.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.	Who are you?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.	How long you and me known each other?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.	Hello.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.	Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
I was drying out.	I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Yes.	Yes.
Look, I told you...	It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
You were asleep.	He told you and you let him do it.
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
I was dreaming again?	I would think so.
They just landed in the desert.	How much time is left?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.	Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
You worry about me really?	Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.	Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?	I don't think we can do that.
Finish what?	He knows. He knows!
I hope you get your work done.	Yeah.
What?	A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Well...	I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?	What is it, Mary?
So now you're bummin' around?	Yep.
Insane ... ?	Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Really? No kidding.	What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Not for a moment.	You're playing games.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.	You don't like it?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.	I guess he got the message...
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.	Hmmm...
Mmm ... what are you doing?	Keeping a stiff upper lip?
No way they could have seen it?	Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?	It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.	THEN WHO DID?!
Only a very little, as soldiers do.	I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...	Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...	We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
I'm thinking Dorsia.	Dorsia's nice.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.	Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!	Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.	Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!	I thought I was the bad guy!
Thanks for the coffee.	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.	Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
I know he left you behind.	My husband is a very courageous man.
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.	I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?	That's what I'm saying.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.	Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?	I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?	No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.	Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.	Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.	The wrong place?
Don't be fooled by appearances.	It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...	Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
I'm missing something.	I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.	Oh, Matt.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.	Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
I don't want them here overnight.	Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.	You have leave to try.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.	Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Two heads.	Better than one.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.	Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.	Only one I can think of.
Yeah.  I got it.	Go.
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.	So I'm still ...
How what happens?	How I go.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.	Okay.
What are you talking about... ?	She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!	Uh. Do you like England?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.	I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.	I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Stop it Mike.	You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.	Oh?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
No way. I can handle this.	This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
I did.	It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
I've noticed.	What shall we call him?
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]	A misunderstood bachelor.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?	What are you... ?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.	No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?	Fifty minutes.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.	I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Poor woman...	No shit.
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?	We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.	Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
You can't buy Wade off.	We bought you.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.	Yes John!
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?	...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
It don't look right.	What?
I was about to throw in the towel.	I had a spot of bother at the door.
What?	If you don't see it, it's not real...
She knows it was our fault!	Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.	You need money again?
Lester?	Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Why did he go that way?	He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Leave him alone!	I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?	Oh, get it over with.
Give me the film.	You'll get it when we get there.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?	Has he been refusing food?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.	I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.	At least he didn't swing with your ride.
How many men?	I couldn't tell.
How was it?	Not good.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...	Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Like this.	I'll get my bag.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.	Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Tonight.	You promise?
I feel a song a comin' on.	A song a comin' I feel.
You're in a hospital in London.	London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.	I'm listening.
No, I don't.	You played it for her and you can play it for me.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.	I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
What's the matter?	Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?	Uh..
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.	Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?	She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.	Maybe.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.	Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
It's illegal, Nick.	It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Where is Mrs. Brown?	She's in the bathroom.
What did you do with her body?	Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
What are YOU doing here?	You may need a real Berserk.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.	Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Hmmm?	...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.	Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Did you say Dude Finlay?	Yes, why?
Nothing like last time, promise.	Alright.
This isn't a game.	Quite right, but we still make the rules.
No!  Not crazy!	Do I look crazy?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?	I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?	This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
What was that?	I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.	She was the one--
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?	Show me again...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.	I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Really, Austin!	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.	Like you care.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.	Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.	I'm tired of waiting.
Where are you going?	Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
What did you do with it?	With what?
Nick... You up?	No.
It's cut.	cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Two weeks?	You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.	But you don't realize....
I don't want any trouble.	Oh, come on, just a little.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.	Looting and pillaging, eh?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.	Do you like it?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.	Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Jennifer.	You're back.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?	I'm not going.
Okay, I guess.	Here we are.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.	That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
This is your bedroom?	No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Where is he, Donald?	He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
You lied.	I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
My name is Manray, goddamnit.	Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?	You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
What kind of problems?	Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
I don't wanna work at all.	In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
He wants money.	Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
This is three years old.	Yeah, I've been busy.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?	Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?	I still don't think it's loaded.
Not just a patient -- me.	You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.	If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?	That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.	Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.	If not you, then who?
Which side do you like?	You choose.
So you like bookstores, huh?	I like to read.
My father has a gun at home.	No.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.	Not if you remember my dad.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?	Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?	Oh well, you know.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.	Uh..you're welcome.
At least, the cat comes back.	You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
What about Pike?	Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Oh shit.	Frank? Can you stand up?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.	Oh yeah?
She's still talking to Jesus.	What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?	I'm not nuts.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.	But he killed a lot of men, too.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?	Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.	Where are they?
Yes, I know that.	Don't let yourself down.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.	Regardless, he still is your father.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.	I want them arrested and hanged!
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.	That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Nobody remembers that.	The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.	Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
I'm here with you.	I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
So am I.	C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!	It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Who the...	Twist of lemon!
The Scots will fight for us?	What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
You're as bad as my father.	And the week before that?
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.	I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Daddy, no!	Just for a minute
Shadow.	How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.	No. You lost your way.
I don't have a story.	Sure you do.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?	Pretty much.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.	What?
"I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"	"That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."
What do you need?	I need ya help again.
They cut the power.	What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--	She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She doesn't want me around	Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
What are you saying?	Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?	Yes.
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
Hello? Jean, I need help!	Where are you?
I don't rightly know, sir.	That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
Bullshit red tape.	I'm heading out. How about you?
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.	I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --	Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.	Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
It was in Latin, sir.	Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
We're quoting Mom again.	Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
No. It's not that.	Do you believe in love?
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --	Where's your shirt, Mueller?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.	That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.	I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
A magic dishcloth.	To the oars!
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...	Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.	All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Jean? Sorbet?	Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.	People watched the movies in their cars?
Elbows, Son.	Sorry, Mom!
That's what we were working on.	Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.	You saw a lot in one night.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.	He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
You almost ended my career before it began.	Pity.
To coincidence.	There's a casino in this hotel.
C'mon, I knew it was you.	Rick, you're lying!
I don't get it.	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
You smoke, Ray?	This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Another dozen out back.	They gonna rush us?
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
Kruger, Sagittarius.	Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yeah Jimmy?	How much of that story is true?
Hey!	Hey!
Even in Berlin.	Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
And your lady?	She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
"""Big and older""?"	You can shut up now.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.	What do you want?
He only weighs ten ounces --	I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.	No, it isn't that.
You must be Edward Bloom.	How did you know?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.	Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Doesn't that come next?	Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?	Five thousand dollars.
I think we better go home.	Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm fine, fine.	You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
I've had enough good news for today	You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?	Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?	Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.	So does Debbie.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --	Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
It's all right. Thanks.	And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Are you all right?	No, I'm not.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.	My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.	You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Exactly.	He's setting that play to music?
I've seen the manuscript.	Where?
Nice to meet you.	That's a sharp jacket.
Yes?	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Oh, yes.	When, may I ask?
Don't tell him you're here.	Why would I?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.	I'd like to buy you a drink.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.	Just a little privacy.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.	This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...	How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Cole...	You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.	Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.	Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
It's more	Expensive?
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!	Doolittle, hello?
Who?	Dorsey.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?	If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
So when was I here?	What do you mean?
Good. It's supposed to be.	I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.	Don't bother!
Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.
Um... Eve?	It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.	That's okay?
How is he?	He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.	Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff	I paid for those guitar cases.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.	So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
He was at the campground yesterday.	So...
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --	So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
Is there nothing men can do?	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...	Righteousness...
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.	Why don't you have more time?
Yes?	The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Shhhh...it's okay.	Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?	Sure.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.	Good-bye, darling.
I don't know.	Doesn't sound like me.
Okay, yeah, call.	Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Can't make you change your mind?	Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
What happened with Nunez?	He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What?	That's not why we're here.
I'll go.	What?
What's your cut?  How much?	I would say...half.  Half is fair.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!	You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Okay, everybody, listen up!	Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Just come down, John. Just --	-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.	My heart weeps.
Does that scare you?	Shut up.
Like?	I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...	Tell me.
What do you think?	Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
But everybody's having such a good time.	Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.	What?!
Mommy, where are you?	Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
And we're good at it.	It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!	"I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't ""Tina,"" it's Seiko."
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.	Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
...I do.	Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.	Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?	Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.	We didn't miss anything.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...	A monster. I know, I know.
I have faced him. Have you?	Let her speak.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...	But if someone miniaturized the process...
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?	Would you, Sir?
That's right.	The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.	I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I know, I know.	If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.	They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?	He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.	Make him stop.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.	Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.	Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.	I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Dr. Monnitoff?	Donnie.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?	Yes!
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.	Suit yourself, I guess.
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...	Still a bit chilly ...
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.	What is the service, sir?
Marcus?	Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
So was I.	Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?	No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
I know, I'm sorry.	He's *paralyzed*!
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.	Sire.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.	Goodnight.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?	Cecelia is, well...you know
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.	Got it.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --	-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Well! Come on!	I... I...
That was kid gloves?	Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
What for?	If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
When I was twenty.	Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.	You got it.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.	And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Tell him to shut up --	-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Did you ever have a baby?	Yes.  A little girl.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.	You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.	Oh, so you know.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.	Do you believe in astrology?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.	It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
...You wanna work -- here?	Got out of my other commitment.
It's battle I want, not talk.	But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
But they start executing hostages in	I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Good cop/bad cop?	Something like that.
I knew.	I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.	Of course.
You're not going to do this?	Why not? Half the house!
Where'd you clip this?	I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Yes.	I don't believe it!
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?	What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?	It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
Possible.  So you did those wings?	Yeah.  A long time ago.
Obviously. That's a given.	Bob?
Yes?	Are you Herr Mozart?
You some kind'a pervert?	No ma'am.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.	What word would you use, Elaine?
Is that a cellar door?	Yeah...
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.	Yes.
Are you sure?	Yes, sir.
Right?	Yeah...
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.	What do I get?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?	I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.	I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.	Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
So what I want doesn't matter?	You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Wait I...	You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
But the right guess on this is arson.	I don't guess.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?	"""There is no second place."" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?"
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?	What did he say?
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.	Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.	That never would of --
No hash browns?	Not in the mood, I guess.
I'm hungry	I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
You got your vest?	Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
What do you mean?	Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
I don't think you will.	I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He look familiar?	Very.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.	Show me.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.	Why not?
Yes.	You must be mad.
Well, go on! Go berserk!	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...	Let me see what I can do.
I was freezing from the hurricane --	So you took off your shirt?
That's right.	Okay?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.	Is he working?
Just an accident. Nothing.	Turn left ahead.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!	Fifty thousand dollars!
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.	You look beautiful to me.
I didn't have the time.	Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.	Then what?
Now they feel it...down below.	Radiation level...constantly rising...
The Greeks. The Italians.	The Sicilians.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.	It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
I don't know --	And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Er, my check, please.	I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.	Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?	What?
The doctor thinks I am. But -	What?
All I have to do is call the guards.	Call them.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.	I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Who gets killed?	Nobody gets killed.
Sure.	He's a boy dog.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.	Yeah.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.	Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.	No.  No way.
You get a call from Rose?	This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
I know that.	Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.	Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?	Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --	I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
I met this girl...	It's always the women that start the trouble.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?	I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...	Global warming?
I haven't brushed yet.	Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.	Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
It was more than that last week.	Yeah.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?	Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
What is it?	Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.	No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Same thing.	I never seen a turtle.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.	The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
What'chu sayin'?	What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Really? Why?	I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?	When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?	NO.
Did you try going through C-Gate?	Yeah. Of course.
What's the problem?	I'm camera shy.
You really are a beautiful woman.	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
OK. Go ahead.	On your marks...  Get set go.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.	But, Your Majesty -
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.	Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
This has nothing to do with your fire.	But what if it does?  You might need my help.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...	Yeah. Guess not.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.	Well, don't worry about it.
They took everything...	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
We're really gonna be in a movie!?	That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
You think he did it?	No --
This is Dorsia?	Yes, dear.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?	Yeah.
Dunbar says you were.	Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?	I will let down the steps for your honor.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.	He got beat up by a girl.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.	There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Me too. There's this poem --	Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.	How is your financial situation?
They left.	What about friends?
I have to.	You want to.
The kitchen.	Very nice.
In the room?	In the world.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.	He has a great body
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!	Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
You okay?	Yeah.
That's true.	Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
You're just reading me.	No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Hey, Mick!	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...	-- Another backdraft.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...	Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.	Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
Who is the boss?	I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?	Find it... AND cross it!
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.	So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
No... You don't think...?	Nah. Couldn't be.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.	Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
It's late, they're closing...	Don't worry about it.
And what in your estimation works?	The umbrella.
I like you too.	One more, eh?
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.	Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Rick, please.	Alright, I think I see salvation...
Straight.	Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
Yeah, boss?	Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.	No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.	Madame.
Next Saturday?	Yeah.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!	It's readin' right.  Look!
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.	What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
I should be committed.	Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Where are you from?	Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!	Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.	He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Uncle, you can't do this!	My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I want to hear everything he said.	I'm trying to tell you.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.	Oh?
Is it one of ours?	No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --	-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.	No!
Is that all the coke in the place?	That's it.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.	I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
What do we have to do?	Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.	Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Kristen, what happened?	You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.	Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.	Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
You found us okay?	Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
I make it six.	Five.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.	He said what?
Something must've happened! What set him off?	I... I blacked out.
It scales, don't you think?	Definitely.
Did you ever turn tricks before?	No.
How can you do that?	I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Right. Something black though.	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Who?	There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Dad!	You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Your father doesn't like me, does he?	It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.	Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Come on.	I'll see you there.
Double A. New Britain.	Oh.
Are you hurting her?	No, protecting her.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.	What are you doing here?
About twenty-four thousand.	It was more than that last week.
Who did this?	We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.	You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Did you tell Alice?	No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.	I'm not so sure about this.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!	I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.	Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I... I was playing with fire.	Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
Right, slow...	Oh, screw it!
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.	I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
He hasn't.	Well, where is he then?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!	Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
I'm fucking out of here.	Lawford?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.	Are you sure?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?	No, I don't.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.	No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.	Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.	No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Which parts?	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.	Why me?
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.	Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.	No, I meant this.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.	Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
The great communicator.	Sorry I hit Jackson.
When I go?	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
I couldn't tell.	Joyce?
Do what?	Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --	-- Sacha, call a cab.
It's more than that.	Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
I'm telling you...	Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
The hotel.	I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
He didn't leave us.	You are a resilient man, Mr.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I	Why not?
I don't want to talk about him.	Fine.
She was the one--	None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.	Here.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.	If you say so.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.	If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
You first.	Shall we?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.	No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.	Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.	Mozart -
Well... yes, quite possibly.	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
What?	It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
About clothing?	Yeah.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.	So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
What is this shit?	Raspberry.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.	Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...	Where the hell is she?
No. I won't.	You're protecting somebody.
YOU do it!	You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?	Leave him alone!
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.	You going to have the time?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.	It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
Manray!	Manray!
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.	Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
I can't go back to sleep again.	I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?	Um-hum.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.	What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.	Has anybody offered to buy it?
Yes...	That's not what happened to your parents.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.	Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You have leave to try.	Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Rick...I can't.	Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?	Of course.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.	What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Who were the victims?	A couple of peons for the mob and...
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.	The king can do no wrong!
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.	You believe?
No one's keeping him here.	Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
You slept too near where you got in?	I slept too near where I fell out.
There is another way.	Who gets killed?
You know mine.	You're famous around here.
Worst day of my life, man.	Well, I'm sold.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.	Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.	So what?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.	Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?	Rick's got an important announcement to make.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.	May we proceed with the business?
I like it up here.	Must get lonely being up here so much.
Agreed.	Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
You don't know how to hotwire.	Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Wade, are you alright?	But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
She was in here when it went down.	Can she I.D. them?
No.  What's my cut?	You get an equal cut.
That sounds great!	Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
What are you gonna name it?	What?
Yes?	You haven't eaten your lunch.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.	Rules are made to be broken.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --	Don't even say it, man.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?	Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
I'll take him.	No way!  He's mine!
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.	The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?	Nobody told me anything.
Apipoussan?	"Good! Do you know how we say ""make love""?"
Okay.	Okay, come on down.
Sh! Hurry!	YOU do it!
Why?	Come here, honey!
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?	All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...	Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.	Thank you.
What's going on in Berlin?	I don't know! Why would I lie?
You lost me.	C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.	What's going on?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.	Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.	How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
That's correct, sir.	Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
I want to go!	Where?
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.	Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...	... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
That was -- different.	...Different?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.	I'm so hungry.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.	Perhaps not.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?	You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?	I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Aces, Suits.	Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.	You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.	I want to go home.
More?	No. Thanks.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?	Of course.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?	They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.	Then we'll stay up together.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.	Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.	No one calls you that.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.	Mr. Hardy?
What's in Sandusky?	Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?	Oh, sure.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.	Just a shower?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.	Yeah, gal I been here before.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.	Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
What's wrong with him?	What do you think?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.	Don't need none.
Ui-vol-i-tub!	Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.
It looks so soft.	Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...	Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.	I'm not positive this means anything.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.	Good morning, sir.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!	Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
It's okay, really.	Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?	Fire.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.	Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Yeah.	Dakota.
He was in the bank yesterday.	He was here?
Hmmm...	So if you detonate in...
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.	Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?	I'm feeling fine this morning.
"Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  ""Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world."" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one."	Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
What?	He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.	Yes sir.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'	I don't get it.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...	No, please! I beg you ...
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!	Really?
This prison gives out $400 suits?	What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
You can probably buy them on the flight.	I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
What's the time?	I don't know.
I called Mommy.	What? You called Mommy? Just now?
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.	Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Holy shit!	What?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.	Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Yes?	Be careful.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?	Yes.
What's the matter?	My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.	That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!	Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.	Right.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...	Father Marchena!
Leeloo... is... she's...	Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I'm the best.	You're the best?
You're not scared, are you?	Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Yeah.	Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.	Please...
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.	There's over eighty thousand here.
What'd you do to her?	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
No.	What about back home?
It's freezing out.	You found us okay?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...	Not now!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.	I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Why'd you let him get to you?	Who?
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.	Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Alas, no.	Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?	Well, he...
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.	That is not possible.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.	You hurt it?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.	Well it worked.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?	Okay, okay, okay--
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?	I don't want anyone to die.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!	Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.	Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.	It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
I still think you're a bastard.	What if I chant?
Gertrude!	It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?	Yeah.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.	And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.	Have we been invited?
Excuse me.  Yes?	Roger Mathison, Doctor.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?	I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.	C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
Digital laser readers.	Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Don't let yourself down.	I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.	I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
You...	I got what I paid for.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.	Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
The rest of the secret service?	Dead.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	I thought you were a December baby.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.	In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Is Mom okay?	She's alive, sweetie.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-	Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.	And why should she?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.	Alright.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...	I shall need a small plane.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!	We think so.
I'm not telling you.	Why not?
And I'm supposed to care?	You could fake it.
Yes, sir.	Well. There it is.
Yes, it is, Hal.	Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
What. What's the matter?	Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?	My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Oh!	You understand?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.	Bourne comes here? Why?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.	I just don't go in with any expectations.
How soon?	This spring.
Really?	"Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off ""you can't have me"" signals!"
-- go -- take the van! --	-- the hotel -- how far? --
Saw him do it?	What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!	I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Where?  Show me where.	I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Dr. Hirsch?	Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Something the matter with the cuisine?	Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.	Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
You want my heart?	It is my only object.
I'm not listening!	On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?	He was a year ahead of us?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.	Brilliant.
Sure.	Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Ma! Please!	Boys?
Eat	Yes.
What's up?	It's about my salary cheques.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?	Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
For the time being.	Good day.
Look in my pack.	Why?
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:	So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.	Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
...Hello?	Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
I want to have a baby.	Let's talk about it later.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.	I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?	I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?	I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
With every breath we shall hunt them down.	Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Thank-Q!	Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
My fucking heart bleeds.	Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
How did you know?	It hit me like a ton of bricks.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.	I didn't.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.	Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
So?	Felt promising. It's a start.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?	I know her. I knew her.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?	O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
Not interested.	Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
It's a miracle!!!	What is?
Well, what do you have for me today?	Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.	The hell are you talkin' about?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.	I hope it's nothing serious.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.	No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --	I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
You sure? That doesn't sound --	I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.	Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Ohio...	That bitch from...
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?	Give it back.
Yeah?	Drafted by the Red Sox.
What about E.M.S. recombination?	We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.	Right.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.	And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?	Maybe.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?	You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!	Nothing we can do, now.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?	How I make my living, what's your point?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.	Good night, Daddy.
Well... where is he?	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
Are you apprehensive?	Why should I be?
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?	Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Well, this might come in handy.	Thank you.
You're lost?	Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Apipoussan!	Apipoussan?
Hey -- do you mind?	Not at all
... love...	Hope...
I'm so excited. Yay!	I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.	'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
What's next?	I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!	A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Frank gone?	Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
When?	Tomorrow, he says.
Two legs, nice rack...	Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.	Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
I'm not interested in what you think.	You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
You-betcha.	My mom wanted me to have this?
We're closed, sir.	Where's that guy going?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?	Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.	Got my letter?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...	No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.	Yeah. It is.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.	The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -	Yes, what about him?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.	And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
You mean a woman?	Uh-huh.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!	Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
He's rich.	Everybody's rich.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.	He electrocuted someone?
"""U.S.A. is A-okay."""	Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?	No thanks. I don't drink.
Who is Frank?	A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...	Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Wait or act.	Recommendations.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.	Yeah. It's pretty good.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.	Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Rudy Levine the shmuck?	Life mocks me even in death.
Excuse me?	My wedding tackle.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.	You leave something out?
Why?	Just...say...no!
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...	Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?	Daddy, *please*...
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.	No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
How did this happen?	I guess they made him do it.
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --	Bullshit --
How much we going after?	Two million.
What are you doing, Ted?	I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?	This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!	Mark...
Nick, you can't do this.	It's done.  You don't have to come.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?	You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
There's no need...	They're dead, aren't they?
LET ME GO!	You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.	She's around. Always is.
"This is our first ""date"" date."	Do you remember what we talked about?
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --	Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I need you to stake me.	Stake you?
I know.	What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
What if you stay this time?	I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Mmm.	You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Oh, yes you are.	I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I won't.	Goodnight.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.	Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Alright, I will.	I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.	Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...	There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
I'm sorry.	My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.	"I'm not crazy about the ""Little..."""
Know what?	Where it came from?
You need money to take a girl out	But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
Don? Where is he?	HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.	Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
You don't usually ask.	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.	I'm the victim here.
That never would of --	Let's cut the bullshit.
You said ... one shot.	Did I? My mistake.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.	Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Herr Mozart -	May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
What do we do?	Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
By myself?	You can handle it.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.	Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Why not? It was just money.	And Danny Zorn, what was that?
I think it's the eyes.	The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?	They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.	Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.	Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Look again for fuck sake!	I know what the fuck he looks like!
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.	This isn't right.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.	...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Then why can't I go in there?	On account of we're robbing it.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.	I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!	But I haven't . . .
Dorothy. No!	If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...	Anything else?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Because I like to torture you.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.	You didn't give them a name.
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.	Yeah, sure, what?
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!	I can't listen to this.
How's the detective business?	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.	It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll be back ...	Where are you going?
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.	Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
I'm Bella.	Jack Manfred.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.	The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?	No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
"""Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice...""  You left my party to send E-mail?"	I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.	Huh.
Yep.	Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Whatcha looking at?	Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Light?	That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
And you still think you can do something to change that.	With your help.
...Not now, Brian.	Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Why not?	Put the camera down, Oleg.
Lay it on me.	I love you, Austin.
No rust?	I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!	Don't speak Russian!
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.	The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?	Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Hang...out?	Yeah. You know...hang out.
No Jeffrey!!	Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.	When is he to go?
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?	Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.	Yes, they are.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?	These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?	Because it's not.
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!	Cut!
Yeah.	You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.	Thank you.
Yeah.	But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Tonight. Let's get together.	Okay.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.	You need to see the prison shrink, man.
It looks awful.	Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Right.	I just hope this is still good up there.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.	Who is...
"""...did."" Well, okay."	Please don't...
Dad!	It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.	You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Why?	This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.	Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?	A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Do you believe in love?	I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
We gotta roll, Stevie...	I'll be there.
What? No you're not..	I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
All the dads are gonna be there.	I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?	Didn't think you'd make it.
We have a visitor.	Hello.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.	Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Not to be trapped.	You underestimate the trap, Mary.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.	I met a girl.
How is gregor?	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
To save the world.	Where have I heard this song before?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.	You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.	Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Sure	Then, go get her
I think you're right.	Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
So! -- He's on your side, too.	Sure.
I'll bring it back.	Erik. You don't understand.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.	The outlets.
Thank you.	Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Stan... c'mon...	Sorry. I just --
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...	Cool, bro, now listen up...
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.	Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Mozart -	They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?	Of course.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...	If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
What's he looking for?	A timer.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
You're a pimp?	I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.	Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --	-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
How do you know this?	Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
The marriage!	Well, what does it matter to you?
All right, then...	So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?	No, I --
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.	Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
"Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what ""bitch"" means, don't you?"	Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
So...who's Nicky?	What do you want?
How is that Wally doing?	Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
