Why not?	Shut up. I'm not listening.
Hello?	Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.	Trychticholorate.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.	How long they been livin' here?
Where's Applejack?	He's stuck between two floors.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.	"Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what ""bitch"" means, don't you?"
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.	You could put it that way.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.	No.
It's just... y'know... I mean...	I know. Anyway --
Debbie's marrying Rick.	...Really?
I miss you. And I miss her.	But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I didn't. Mother did.	Mother?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.	Whoa, whoa... There he is.
Glenn talked you out of it.	Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.	No. Come on.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?	Will you give me a break?
I don't want to take you out of your way.	It's okay.
She's not in the gaming business is she?	No.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.	This way ...
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.	Who?
How do you know?	Because I was standing next to him.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.	Thank you, Basil.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.	Sh!
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.	And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Go on.  Good so far.	I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --	Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.	Sort of like a letter of intent.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --	What are you talking about?
Why should you care?	Why... should YOU care?
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.	Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.	Why should we care?
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.	I sure don't hate you.
Where are you going, Sebastian?	Just thought I'd...
Bye, Adam!	And thanks for always being happy!
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.
That's affirmative.	Ga get it.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.	Oh, yes.
Max--	Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
You know what happened to this?	As much as anybody.
This is it? The whole vault.	'Fraid so.
You like it there, don't you?	The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.	Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
She went back to South Africa.	Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
What?	Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I don't know they just always need it.	"What is all this ""they"" shit? This ain't a movie."
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.	Simon.
Who cares?	Now, now. He's a good boy.
Your health...	Ta ss'trakyona'...
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.	Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.	Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?	He wouldn't move.
Look at the treads on those.	What about them?
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.	Get down on your knees.
I didn't say shit.	That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
You're the only one missing a grenade.	Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
I don't know.	We need the plate to negotiate with.
He's *paralyzed*!	He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
How do I know you didn't?	So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
A limousine has just pulled up.	Let me see.
What's this?	It's nothing. I burnt myself.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.	What're you talkin' about?
How many times have you seen Frank?	Four times... so far.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --	Milo --
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.	I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Tell them to go!	Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.	That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?	Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.	No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.	Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Luther was part of the gang?	What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Distracting enough for you?	Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
What does it mean?	Maybe you will find out.
Moonan. Here. Shit...	So what? We just stay clear of him.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.	But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.	That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Please join us.  Come on forward.	Is there a problem?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?	Under <u>water</u>?
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.	No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
How old am I?	I don't know.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.	I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?	Don't be fooled by appearances.
Mr. Treves! Treves.	John.... how can you ever forgive me?
THEN WHAT?	Then you got undressed.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.	What?
That's what I would have done.	I'm not hanged yet.
Opera? Opera!	Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.	My little Web did that?
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.	No. But you tend to tie them up.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.	Go! Just go!
Then who's the Banker?	The King.
Yeah.	For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Yeah.	Vodka.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?	Italian.
I want you to stay with me.	I think I better go.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?	I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
I want to know what happened.	What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Good morning, sir.	You've acquired a taste for this?
Look, I don't know what this...	Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Sacha, she's had enough.	Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.	Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.	Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.	I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
No, really!	This is just a game, Papa.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!	You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!	Say what?!
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?	Impossible to calculate.
You take it straight?	Sure.
Hey, Rick!	Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?	I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Jesus, what happened?	West... he's dead.
Why not?	Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.	Well, you obviously don't know me.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!	We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.	Yes, you do.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.	Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Except for Small Eyes.	Except for Small Eyes.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.	No, this is me in a nutshell.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.	Did we tape the Duke game?
Hi.	Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....	Thank you for calling the white House...
Yes.	So now - A minor. Suddenly.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?	A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.	I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?	A daughter.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.	You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Shall we let the people come in?	Of course, let them in! You're late now.
What?	Nothing.
And how was your Christmas?	Terrific.  Yours?
Who?	Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.	...I do.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.	What shall we do?
You sure?	Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Stop it, you two!	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
This is crazy.	That's why it will be so much fun.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.	You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.	And these cops? What do they get?
What's in it for you?	Your help.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?	You don't.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.	Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Thanks.  For everything.	No sweat.
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?	Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.	Yeah, I guess.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?	Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
You left out condescending.	But there's another side--
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.	What else, my dear Major?
A friend of your fiance's.	What do you want?
When?	After six.
The cash man!	Been here long?
How could it not, Excellency?	Yes?
Excellent.	Where are the women?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?	He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
That's terrible!	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.	No Jeffrey!!
Why would you do a thing like --	You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.	He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.	I'll try.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?	No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Why, yeah.	I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
You don't have to.	I'm going with you.
I'm not even going to dignify that --	No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Let's hack her to pieces.	No.
Be careful!	Be careful!
It knows us. This one knows us.	I need that report, Lt.
Yes?	You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Why is she trying to kill me?	They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!	It wasn't like that.
How long until it blows?	I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...	Will you shut up!?!!
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...	Stop talking.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --	-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
What do you want to do?	I'm doing it.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?	That's what it looks like to me.
So what was he?	I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.	Is it safe?
Now -- er --	Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.	Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.	But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Why?	She may try to kill you.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.	What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Slower! In... Out...	Sorry!
This is he?	No. This is he.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.	Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?	I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
How ya doin' Dad?	Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?	Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Where're you going, Ichiro?	The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Bravo, Your Majesty!	Well done, Sire!
Thanks.	Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.	WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.	That's unique.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.	Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
You're impossible...	That's what I always say.
I figure.	See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.	Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.	Is Sandy part of this?
You can't go now.	I have to.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.	I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
How long will we have to stay down here?	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.	That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.	I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.	It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Really.	Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?	Yes.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.	I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Do you always live like this?	Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?	Nothing.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.	Tell everybody hey.
Check at six minutes.	Arm yourself, bomb.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.	Cole, I'm sorry, I...
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!	Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Bullshit.	All right! Backyard! Right now!
What?	Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
What do I do?	What do you do?
Something like that	Then you screwed up
So you decided to go to America.	Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.	Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Dignan, it's too late.	I don't think so.
His escape.	Oh, but I just told you. --
Huh huh.	Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Forget it.	Forget her sister, then.
Paul Owen.	I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
No.	Right.
People watched the movies in their cars?	When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.	What?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...	Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.	"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.	I will.
That's a <u>face</u>???	Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.	Or half cocked.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?	Would you? Actually, you could.
I guess it isn't.	Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?	He's telling the truth, up to a point.
The cockpit? What is it?	It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
How?	I don't know for Christ's sake!
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...	And the bad news?
Cole slaw, ice tea?	Thanks.
Have you not a man whom you value?	That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Whore?	I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
You don't need to be here.	What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
He will come back.	Excuse me?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.	I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.	Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
What is?	running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.	It's okay. It's okay.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?	He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He drove me mad!	Easy, Dad!
A wife?	Yes.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?	Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Why?	Please, I must get out here.
You stay with me.	Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.	Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
No, you...didn't?	Now, if you'll excuse me.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.	What do you want me to *do*?
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.	Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
When, may I ask?	In three months! Papa.
You say...	The River!
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.	Hector woudn't do anything.
She say what time I should call?	The sooner the better.
Tell me...	I love you...
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.	Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
You look awful.	So do you...been a long day.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Could you do somethin' for me?	Anything.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.	Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
And it's called...?	Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I checked it out. It's clean.	Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
You want a dressing bag, John?	You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Everybody did.	I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Not yet. What do you know about it?	I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --	His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
So...the station is empty?	Yeah.  This way.
To Wilson.	To Wilson.
I'll get him.	There's not enough time.
Sure...	And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.	The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
You killed him you fucking faggot --	We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
I don't think so. Just reach on in.	That sets it off.
Traitor!!	No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.	I begged him not to go. And he did.
Nothing about you.	Then what?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.	We'll have to pick up a copy.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.	What I love.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.	Move it, dirtbag... !
Say what?!	How do you do, ma'am.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]	Oh now, don't be silly.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.	What?
Don't fool around.	Okay.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.	I beg your pardon?
What do you want for Sam?	I don't buy or sell human beings.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.	I don't think I will, Rick.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
What do you want?	To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.	It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?	Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
You're not real.	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!	What?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.	Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
That's too bad.	You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.	B-L-A-K it is.
A bustier?	Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
I don't want to talk about it.	Why not?
So you're still on the Zoloft?	Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Lay off, asshole.	I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
For your hands?	Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah.	What was I wearing?
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.	I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.	I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.	What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Let me see that.	"Oh, I'm not finished.  ""When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple.""  As I said. Hmm."
Get the picture?	And that fits?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.	Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Soon, baby.	Mommy, I'm scared.
-- what? --	-- take the back -- get another car --
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.	We'd be the first!
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.	How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
My Debbie?	What's with her costume?
Terrible.	Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.	Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.	There are limits?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.	May I finish?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.	Exactly. Woah.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?	We're your guys.
I had training. In the Republic.	You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
Love! I'm made of love!	Call it what you want.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.	Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.	You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?	Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
What're you laughing about?	Napoleon... small.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.	I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.	Stop it Mike.
You know what I think about, Talby?	I'm getting something here, on this readout...
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?	'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I mean your parents.	I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?	Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.	Line?
I bet I would.	Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.	You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
-- Burn them.	And old ladies?
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight...	I can't do it...
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.	I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.	If I say no?
It was open.	You got a lotta nerve.
I've already got more help than I need.	I think you need more help than you've got.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...	Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Who did cause and origin?	Who do you think, Chief?!
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.	There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Why?	Because she'll scare them away.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?	Oh, darling!
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.	Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.	I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.	We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.	Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
So how long will you be in England?	Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?	What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --	Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.	How can you? I mean they're people.
They suspended me for two days.	Are you okay?
Always a pleasure, Brucie.	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.	That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.	I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.	I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.	I did. You said, things were fine.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.	Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?	You mean Twombley?
You told me to look, so I looked.	You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
You alright?	Kristen...
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.	A dubious distinction, no?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.	And got well paid for it on both occasions.
She's working on another lead right now.	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.	Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.	But...has anyone seen him in London?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.	Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
I am very pleased to meet you.	I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
No.	For the last time, put them on the table.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?	Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Okay.	Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
I can't believe this.	And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?	I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.	Nurse!
Can't get it. It won't...	What can we do?
Yeah.	Then c'mere. I got something for you.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.	Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.	Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
I'm going to get started on dishes.	I'll help you.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."	He hasn't played it in a long time.
Yakuza.	Good.  Very good...
Just say something cheerful.	Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.	Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?	Strange.
You better take Powell and Carney with you --	The frogmen?
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?	It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?	Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.	How do you know I'm not?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.	Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Fuck that. We're going too.	Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.	Putty? On both doors?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...	Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?	Watching television in color.
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
Mrs. Leeman?	Huh?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?	Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...	They tried... but I didn't let them.
Sure you did.	What?
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.	Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.	The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
If you say so.	I do.
Who is this girl?	You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
He left his sweater.	Well, I left some money in there.
Is that right, Rambo?	All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
I can see him right now!	Where is he, Donald?
It's not a plan. It's just --	Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
I've got to go, now.	Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.	Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.	Uh-uh.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.	Let's see your bread.
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.	I'll have to enclose the check first.
What the fuck are you doing?	I-I'll tip her.
Who?	Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.	Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?	Yeah.
No. I should go.	Please, please stay.
Just get out, didja?	Huh?
Well -- you sent for me.	Right... Right.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?	Sure, right.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?	Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
The theatre?	That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?	Sam's piano.
Alice, you think you can leave?	What's wrong?
How long have you known my father?	Thirty years. Maybe more.
Your mother mates out of season.	That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.	I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
How did you land that?	It came my way. 450 a week.
Where's the beauty you promised me?	It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.	I hope so. I need it immediately.
Oh my son, my poor son!	Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Commander Powell would have named it.	Commander Powell is dead.
I'm not hanged yet.	You cocky little bastard.
This is hardly the time or the place.	Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.	Yeah.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.	Good call.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
No, not at all.	Who knows you have these?
My job is here.	Me too.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.	And his baggage?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.	I think it's the eyes.
Maybe.	No, you weren't
What desert?	Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --	Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?	I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.	No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
But why can't we stay here?	Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!	Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.	Really? Why?
Where are you going?	I'm going home.
I'm a little busy right now --	This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.	I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
No, Daddy.	So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.	Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
What is it?	Your 'out.'  This came for you.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.	Okay.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.	So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?	Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Ow! You shot me!	Right. Okay. Moving on.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?	What's it worth to you?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.	You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.	C'mere. I love you so much.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Men... men... what happened, men?	Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.	I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Don't you open your messages?	I've had enough good news for today
What is it?	Patrick?
Yeah.	How much did he pay you?
Jean-I'm not-	Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Would you like a Coke or something?	Oh. No thanks.
Pumpkin?	Yes?
My name is...	My... name is...
What does he look like?	You might be disappointed.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?	What's to discuss?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.	Rose, I don't have time for this.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?	Who's Whiskey Dick?
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!	You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?	Does it matter?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...	I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.	I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.	Dino...
Are you Detective Williams?	Yes.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.	The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Would you? Actually, you could.	My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.	You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Hi.	Inez, this is --
He's my collar!	Well, he killed my partner!
Did my work please you?	How could it not, Excellency?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?	What do you think?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...	Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Probably not. No. Why?	Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Some women like Dobermans --	What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!	All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.	Yes, sir.
You don't want to.	But she does work here?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --	Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.	Thanks.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...	Don't tell me what to think.
You cannot say that!	No? Was Mozart a good man?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.	The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.	What are you serious?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.	Unlikely.
Who are you?	Bruno's girlfriend.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.	You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?	The easy way.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.	The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Were you born in Mexico?	Cuba.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.	But not the only victim, right?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.	Is it one of ours?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...	Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Who's going? Us?	There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.	I didn't have a choice.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.	Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.	Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.	I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!	You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Where is she?!	She's right over there.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
So how does it happen?	Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.	Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
What are you doing here?	I heard there was a poetry reading.
Where did I stop?	The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.	Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?	It's just not.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.	I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.	You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.	You read my mind.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!	Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --	Um --
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.	Guess so.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.	Let me see the tracking alignment display.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.	You knew me as a kid.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?	Yeah, if it opens the door.
Nothing.	I know what it is.
I don't understand, who are... ?	I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.	You mean she's dead?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.	A leader, like Laszlo?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.	Did you get the case for the securities?
He was looking out for you.	"Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to ""fuck some sense into me."""
'Us?'	Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
And that's all?	Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.
Female.	At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...	Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Who else can I ask around here?	Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?	A fellow investor.
When do I begin?	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
So what do you want me to do?	I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Did it work?	No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
"Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming ""Mother Machree."""	"It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings ""Mother Machree"" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time."
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?	Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.	If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?	Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.	"I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN."""
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
Ted!	I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.	Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
What are you talking about, Erik?	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
They have noble faces.	I've always thought that myself.
Not now, Sven...	I must KILL! Kill!
Ripley...	She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...	Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
Yeah?	Listen!  Hear that?
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!	Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
You're sure?	I'm sure.
Oh my God, he's back.	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.	You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
I've been working double shifts.	Extra money, huh?
I'll make some for us.	I'll get my clothes.
Thirty-two.	Get out!
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.	I know.
Why do they call you Frank?	It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...	What... ?
Yes.	What did he say?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.	You're crazy.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.	Miles...
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...	Don't mess with me. How much?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.	That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Yeah.	Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Come with me.	Where are we going?
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.	It's not somebody else.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.	He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.	And so I am.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.	Could these wormholes appear in nature?
"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
Peace?!	We cannot defeat this --
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.	Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
No offense.	Manray needs a job.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.	And it is my pleasure to be here.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.	I'm not a cop.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!	Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.	Do you want to stop?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...	So when was I here?
Would you like a tranquilizer?	You have tranquilizers?
I'd love that.	Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
But how do you know you exist?	It is intuitively obvious.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.	My Lt. might have something to say about that.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.	Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?	Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
You like mysteries that much?	Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.	You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.	Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.	I need someone to translate for me.
Seems too coincidental that way.	Yeah, maybe.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?	I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
You sound like the media.	This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Dea ex machina...	What did you say?
Shakespeare.  He's European.	Ah.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!	I'm -- I'm sorry...
When dad died, I saw another fire...	Everybody did.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.	And ours.  It's our grandchild.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.	Sweet Jesus.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --	Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.	"Let me tell you ""scary,"" Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a ""lifer"" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent ""raisin ranch"" where they'll change me twice a day."
Put it down!	What is this?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.	I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.
Oh? And what should I say?	Just...say...no.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.	No. Just confidence.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.	But Dad --
Four minutes ago.	So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.	Or what? OR WHAT?
Hmmm.	Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.	Yeah, I got it.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.	So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Are you neglecting my request?	No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
Wallace has sacked York!	Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
Not in that company.	The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Where are you going?	I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?	Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
His name was Swifty?	Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
There.	Thanks.
What?!	How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!	What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Clementine.	I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Yeah? What have you been up to?	I work for city hall.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.	Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!	BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
CONTINUED	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
But if we take their money and supplies...	Exactly.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.	I shouldn't tease a hero.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.	So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.	Hello, bomb.
Fifty thousand dollars!	But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.	Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Is that all you wish to tell us?	Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?	I guess not.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?	Hi.
What d'you mean?	I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
You like that?	Very much.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?	Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!	Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
You and the Colonel go back.	He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
This isn't working out.	We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?	It was a lot of fucking money.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.	I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I guess so.	I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
No what?	No.
You want a Dairy Queen?	No way. I'm about to blow up.
I got to wait for a call.	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.	You don't want the extra police pay?
We gotta talk.	What's up?
Four...	Jim...
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.	Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Oh, Rufus!	All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?	The KISS Army!
What?	I want to buy a car.
That's what I said!	But - what can we accomplish?
--and we will--	And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?	You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?	It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.	There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
"How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for ""formal questioning?"""	0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.	And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Tell me.	Your mother mates out of season.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.	And how will you make him keep it?
Joyce?	I don't know.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.	Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.	This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.	We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...	Don't you even think about it.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.	Look, you can have my wallet...
It's their Presidential Suite.	Great.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.	Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Let it be rain, please let it be --	Stay by the window. By the window.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.	Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
It's not your job.	He was my partner.
Ooh, be still, my heart.	See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!	You could have told them!
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?	Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.	Certainly!
What do you mean?	Isn't it obvious?
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!	Jake, I mean, come on --
Viewer discretion advised!	You want the tape?  There it is!
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...	Did you do any of that?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.	All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?	What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?	Name it.
Yeah?	Just wanted to let you know.
I couldn't find any razor blades.	Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
I want you on call here.	What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.	See, I wouldn't think that about you.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.	Ah, love again.
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?	No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
Shut up.	Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!	Wonderful!
-- Thank you.	By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
That's right.	I see.
Shut up, Tommy!	Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.	I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.	Where are we now?
Yeah? Why?	Why do you interfere with my little romances?
O'Grady.	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
No.	What do you want, then?
Uh-huh.	I gotta go get a haircut.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.	I hope it's not the oven again.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.	Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
This is totally unnecessary --	He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
What then?	It's stupid.
Jean? What?	Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
There's not much illegal.	Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Meet me at the other location.	Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
What?	You...
They'll come anyway. They love me here.	No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.	Anything else?
What?	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Dorsia, yes?	Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Thank you, but I hardly think --	-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?	Don't know.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.	You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Do what?	Get her to act like a human
Yankee Poodle.	I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.	I can't, it's yours.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.	Oh.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?	About seventeen days.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.	Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?	"""Hell up here?""  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.	Fine, thirty.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?	"""Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!"" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'."
...Shit!	What is it?
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
Yes.	Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Yes.	How are things going at school?
I'm looking for a lady who works here.	Ladies would be elsewhere.
No need to be modest, Brian.	No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.	I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.	No, I ' m not.
We never went to bed together.	Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.	Nobody does.
"But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called ""On the Street Where You Live.""  You know it?"	Sing it to me.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?	Fine.
Do you own a car?	I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
"""There is no second place."" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?"	Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?	Of course.
"""Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."""	Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.	She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
To life.	That's all there is.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.	There are only two other alternatives for him.
Absolutely not.	That ' s what I thought
How do you do?	How do you do?
Neat...	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...	I get the picture.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.	I stole four beers from my dad.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?	Yes, Basil?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?	I didn't have the time.
He's out of prison?	"They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his ""act of revenge."""
Thanks.	Welcome, Howard.
What -- What do we do?	Help me.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...	...the big apple, New York, New York.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.	It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Excellency!	Madame. How can I help you?
Would you like to be modified?	Had in mind something a little more radical.
Is she...?	Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.	It's no big deal.
"We said ""no questions."""	Here's looking at you, kid.
Who's that?	"I think they call him the ""Houseman."" 'Cause ""guard"" sounds too weird."
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.	Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Of course. I planned that, too.	But -- why?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?	Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?	What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?	Not me.
Is it safe?	Absolutely.
Not bad.	Come on in. What you been up to?
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...	A girl.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.	The zoo? Is he rational?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.	If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Let's go.	Nick, we can't just --
I have to get to Sugai.	Goodbye, officer.
No, he doesn't.	Are you sure?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...	I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!	Well, I didn't but...
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?	Yes, go on.
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest	I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Really?  Okay!	And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.	It's not for sale.
They got their stories straight.	What?
Meant no offense.	None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
He doesn't know about the Day Care.	Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Leave Stephen out of this --	Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
No. There's nothing new.	You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
What?	I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
What the...?	I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.	If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I understand. I'm so sorry	You can stay tonight.
He's lying.	Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?	No.  I need a drink.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.	Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?	Nah...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.	Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.	You're pretty good at arithmetic.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.	What is it, Hal?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.	No trouble.
Ted!	Elaine, what's going on?
This Rae... you get with her?	Shit. Who hasn't?
No. I think I better just go.	Okay. Thank you.
Why not religion, Dad?	It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.	Did you get his number?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?	Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.	It's okay. I didn't think you were.
They're migrants.	Migrants?
Yes.	Jesus, why?
Ah - you've heard that?	All Vienna has heard that.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.	I ain't mad at you...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?	Since my little girl became a mom...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.	Why?
Yes...	I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.	Certainly.
We went to a hotel.	My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?	Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
And I think it's because of this redhead...	Know who I am, Jake?
What kind of plane are you flying?	A B-24 Liberator.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?	I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
"Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of ""seeing the world,"" isn't it?"	Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Incredible.	The Emperor has given him permission.
...this is Conklin's computer.	...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.	You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.	As long as he gets out OK.
You don't celebrate til it's over.	True.
Ah. Italian?	Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
I thought I told you to move that truck!	Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!	Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?	Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Yes, sir. It's true.	"What? Did the politburo just one day say - ""We give up?"""
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.	No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...	I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?	Not that I know of.  Explanation?
The key!	Key? Key? What is the key?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?	Nobody special enough, Curly.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.	Oh, come on, tell us.
What're we looking for?	Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm *not* a doctor!	I'm sorry, Homer.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.	Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
He's not?	Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.	Still...
You didn't...	Every week.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?	I probably got the same thing as you.
Is the social studies class over for today?	Yeah...
How much?	This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?	She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --	It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.	Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?	I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I, I don't know.	What do you want?
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.	Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
I haven't any.	You haven't got a uniform?
Oh, how do you do?	And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.	We're doing this for Ma.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?	Not even that.
No, sir.	My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
You saw West's body.	Of course --
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?	Yes, sir.
Somewhere down there?	Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Did Dignan take the test?	Yes, he did.
We know.	I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
Peter's brother?  But --	Half-brother to be precise.
It didn't go off.	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?	And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Angela?	Yes?
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?	There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.	She's alive?
What time was it?	Huh?
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?	Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.	Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""	I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Are you quite sure?	Yes, really, thank you very much.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?	Now I'm embarrassed.
When? Now? Oh. No.	Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Thank you.	I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
How's it going?	Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...	We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Jake...	It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?	Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
That was for you.	"I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling ""peanuts"" in front of the House of Representatives."
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.	You're sure?
The hell is this shit?	What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.	Milt?
I pushed him too hard.	You couldn't have known --
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.	Please.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.	And the bodies?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.	I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Excuse me?	He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Treadstone.	Never heard of it.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.	I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I see.	When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
No.	Had his apartment been burglarized?
Uh, my watch stopped.	I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?	Sitting next to you.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --	Yes, Sister?
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.	Right.
You okay, Jesse?	Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I don't want to hear that word!	Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.	Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.	Thank you.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.	What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Your brother was a good man.	Yeah.
See you Tuesday, Frank.	Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
...to the office this afternoon.	Why?
Hitchhiking?	I'm the best.
They'll get us.	Maybe.  Maybe not.
Shit.	How long's it been since you flew, sir?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.	Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
See you later.  Good luck.	Thank you.
Yes.	This is Dorsia?
No.	All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Mom!	I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Let go of my arm...	Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.	I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Right, the big one-oh.	But I'll take a rain check...
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --	Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?	Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Who?	The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
The Army can hang him.	Tomorrow.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?	Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Why not go to work for me?	Doing what?
Yeah, like that.	Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
Just a little something' somethin'.	I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
I don't know.	Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Shut up.	Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Shall I leave, M'lord?	If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?	What's to believe?
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.	While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Yeah it was okay.	Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Why?!	I don't want to be alone.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --	-- shut up! -- just shut the --
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.	Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.	Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.	Do you know what his budget was?
Leave him alone.	Fuck off.
Mary. What are you doing here?	She came to help, Howard.
... love ...	Fear ...
Cyclops?	Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.	Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
I treated you better.	You treated me like shit.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.	If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
That'd be nice.	I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.	Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.	Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --	Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Why?	Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.	Hello. And goodbye.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.	Hmmmm.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.	Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Who with?	Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.	What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I just think you used to be bad.	No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
That's your friend Anthony?	Yeah.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.	And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
We'll come again.	Any time.
Hurricane kept you up, too?	Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.	Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Right away, Exposition.	Where is Vanessa, by the way?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?	Sea bass.
Who?	The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
How old are you?	Eighteen.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?	I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You did what?	Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
This is why you don't show work in progress.	Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You truly are a dancing fool.	Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Of course I recognised him!	You did?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.	Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
I didn't know.	The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
"Are we on ""Cops"" again?"	You could be quiet.
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.	C'mon, let's crawl home.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.	Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar	Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Oh my god!	I...
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.	Then when? I have to talk to you.
Rae don't do this now...	It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I know.	I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
A daughter.	So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.	Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Gladys! Stop it!	Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
You don't have any other choice.	No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.	Leave me alone.
Make love?	Have sex. Y'know --
Those sluts!	Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
Please don't go there.	Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?	Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.	Did we get our bill yet?
So simple to say, so hard to do.	Not when you have no choice.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.	And why is that?
I just wanted to ask you...	Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Come up and see me... now.	It's very late.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?	It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Have you any place in mind?	As a matter of fact I have ...
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.	Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?	It's a secret.
Rockville Center.	Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
You're beautiful.  Marry me.	You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
What for?	I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?	Okay.
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...	But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!	A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Nick --	Shut-up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.	Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Upstairs.	Gertrude!
You start.	The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.	Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
Are you in show business?	I was a successful model once.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!	Crawl!
Destroy it?	If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.	Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.	You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Let's wait for some slow one.	Just a minute.
What time is it?	It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."	Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.	I'm sure, I said.
Think she really killed those agents?	She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.	Right.
So you do know her.	Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
What is it?	Police drone.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.	Baron!
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.	...What?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.	When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.	What's your name, Giant?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?	He's going to be a fireman.
I'm so sorry.	Leave her alone.
Yo ho ho!	It's three.
So what's your excuse?	Acting the way we do.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?	Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
I was just being honest.	Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?	I'm not leaving you.
Why not?	Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.	You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
But still died.	If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Break stuff?	Yeah. It's stupid.
It got to be too much for him.	You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?	Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Stephen, what are you doing here?	Fixing my roof.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?	We are not stealing my mom's car.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.	That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
You have no shame.	Not yet. But I'm hoping.
How did your speech go?	Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.	Take it back. Till you sell your book.
It must be done right away.	I can't do it right away.
No.	Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.	No, I understand.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.	You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!	Amy...
Keep stallin'.	Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.	Hey, man, congratulations!
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!	There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Your mother?	Here.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?	It's just you.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.	I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!	Now see here young man.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --	-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
When is she not in trouble?	Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
I just did.	Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Take it, damn it.	No.
Money! Money!	You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
See my nipples?	Yes.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.	I-I c-can't...
What?	I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
What is wrong?	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
So where is your roommate, the model?	You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.	In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.	I want women.
What makes you think so?	You're all so perfect.
Hi!	I'm Randy.
She disappeared... shit!	You were too far behind.
You're all through with this now?	Yes sir. I sure am.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.	That's what everybody believes?
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.	Negative.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.	That's easy enough.
Nope.	Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
"So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."	Queen Harry?
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?	Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!	Well, come on!
Yeah.	Where are we going?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.	Yeah.  Right.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.	How are you doing?
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?	Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Just wanted to let you know.	I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.	Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
"I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."	They hack into people's programs?
Okay, I believe you.	We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?	Minus three.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.	My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
But Richard, no, I, I --	-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
You might be right.	Why are you smiling so?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.	What do you think, Adam?
And the world -- the whole world.	-- Burn it all.
Because you're... different.	Different? How?
I've got something to tell you.	I want to hear it.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.	What shows?
No thanks. I'm good.	Come here!
Hey. You OK?	My mom is gone.
It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh
Where's the magnet?	They've been tested.
"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind."	So you took the rest of the night off...
For a man in my position --	Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.	Do you take American Express?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.	Fine...
Full clip to the body --	From up close or far away?
Dorsia.	Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?	God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Who have you been talking to?	I met this girl...
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.	The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?	I thought I did.
Teh... Tehronne?	Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.	With, like, images?
Oh, hello ...	We want Mrs. Peel.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.	Why not?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.	Good deal Dad.
You feel good, not nervous?	I feel fine.
I want a firm commitment.	I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?	Yes, thank you, sir.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?	Yes, Mr. President.
Yeah.	Well, that's great.
I want to know you.	I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...	He'll find us. We go talk to him.
It's not for sale at any price.	What do you want for Sam?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.	What difference will it make?
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!	You weren't dreaming about me.
Do you believe in it?	What?
Striker.	Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
He's planning a job.	What?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..	Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Yes?	Nothing.
Still time.	Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Why are you so anxious?	Don't you know?
It didn't feel like a dream.	Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?	Why - well, I
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?	I met this girl.
How long have I been here?	Three days.
No.  I mean your relationship.	We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.	Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?	Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Why?	Luther's on the move...
There was a mistake.	I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?	I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.	Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Why you say that?	She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.	I can't stand it.
Yes, Doctor?	What exactly did he call out?
Yeah...I guess.	You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.	I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
The King, huh? Nice going.	I try.
Talk about work? Never!	I meant did you find other stuff to --
Do I make you horny?	What?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.	No!
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?	They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
You think you could explain all this to me?	I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?	We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?	I don't.
That's not why we're here.	What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
Yeah.	Good god.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!	Sssh! Stay here.
Not likely.	Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Huh?	At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.	I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Who are you?	They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
I don't know it.	If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?	It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.
Do you have something to prove?	Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I want him to at least see the sky!	--and we will--
I skipped lunch.	Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
What's that?	That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.	Take your hands off me!
Yes.	Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.	Then who wrote the report?
A soft side? Who knew?	Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Fine. I'll just wait here.	I'd appreciate that.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.	They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Yes.	What for?
Enid ate a whole pan!	I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
I'm really sorry.	What am I going to do?
That it wasn't an accident.	Then who shot him?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --	Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Aw come on, Alex!	Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Now see here young man.	Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Why do you say that?	Well, because you guys don't look alike.
She okay?	I hope so.
I guess not.	It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Well, she... uh...	Was she nekkid?
No, what is it?	Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.	Something like that. You?
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!	So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
So?	It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.	It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
So how is it in there?	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
More like deployed in bed asleep.	I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Want to buy?	Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Oh. What's wrong now?	I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
What's in the box?	For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Bob, will you please listen?	I don't want to talk about it.
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
Okay, we're back in.	That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Okay.	Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Fuck you.	Anytime.  Anywhere.
Eight A.M. flight.	Calls?
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?	This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You burned the score?	Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
But, mom!	Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?	Right?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --	We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.	Yes.
And what?	Well...
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!	We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Would you say you understand Josephine?	Yes. But that's a different...
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.	I don't gamble.
But I haven't . . .	I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?	She says she 'likes me too much'.
What are you...	I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
What's that mean?	We did not leave together.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...	Nobody saw you bring her in?
Why should they think that?	You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Where are you going?	I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.	He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Next time it'll be my neck.	What about my neck?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.	There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.	I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
They are.	So who's going to know?
And the other alternative?	My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
Don't move.	Sorry.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.	I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
Consigned to flames of woe.	Do you believe in it?
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --	You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.	She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No.	Falling.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.	In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.	I had a feeling you would. Touche!
I can't believe he just jumped you.	Can you hand me those french fries.
Aaagh! Rape!	Oh, thanks.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.	About raping me?
I met a girl.	What is her name?
You in a hurry?	I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.	You're sure? It's cold.
He's adorable!	Adorable!
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...	You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Can't argue that.	So what was he?
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.	Okay.  Sure.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --	Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Er, good luck, yes.	I'd better be going.
Has he now?	You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Thanks a lot, Mom.	Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.	No, nothing.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.	Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?	Just one... why me?
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Ten is standard, sir.	Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
Mr. Kessler?	Yes?
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.	You could do worse.
Now I become custody of police department?	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
And how will you make him keep it?	Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
I know your parents.	I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.	I know all that.
I don't want to die.	Are you afraid?
Yes.	"I mean... ""Ants."" ""I've got a problem with ants."""
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.	I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.	You what?
You didn't...	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...	-- Never mind.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.	Right.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.	And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
I already don't like the sound of this.	The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
Mr. Thomerson.	Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I think we should go...	Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
No, I'm lost.	You're lost?
And how are we today?	Terrible.
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.	What do you want me to do?
So that's it...	That's it.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!	We were attacked by a werewolf.
Key?	Where's the fail-safe key?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --	You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Made by YOU, Loki!	By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
Not quite.	From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.	All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Finally, we can bargain.	I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Hey, bomb...	And I saw that I was alone.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.	What?!
Yes.	Get on it.
I don't know.	Who sent you to Greece?
You're kidding.	Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
What way?	After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Yes?	I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.	Am I?
He should be king!	And wear a crown and everything.
How many pupils do you have?	Pupils?
What do you whistle?	Yankee Poodle.
It must be great.	And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Don.	What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
So how'd you like the house?	His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Yes.	My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.	What about a drink on the way home?
Yes, sir.	Let me see your cash book, will you?
This is not a place you wanna go.	Let go of my hand.
Be careful.	I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.	I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
What's it to you?!	I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Occupied France?	Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.	I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Go back to Bulgaria.	Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes?	Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
What kind of show is this gonna be?	Different.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.	Hello Ugarte.
What case?	The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Excuse me	Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...	You are a fine figure of a man.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...	What I think is going on with your son.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.	I don't want them here overnight.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...	Well, how d'you think I feel?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?	I had training. In the Republic.
Much better.	And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Sounds good, pops.	Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.	Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...	Gonna get married...
Jeremiah, what are you doing?	Uhh... nothing.
Burke!  Open the door!	Look!
So who was he with?	He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.	I have heard of them.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --	Just shut up?
"What happened to ""degrees""?"	I didn't kill him --
So, what's the topic of discussion?	I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
It's possible.	Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Chub says you're fired.	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.	Sir?
Never.	But, for a time... a passing fancy?
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?	A-fuckin'-men!
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.	Why?
Well, it's kind of weird.	We don't judge here.
What the fuck are we doing out here?	I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
No thanks, Carl.	Monsieur Rick!
Sir, yes, sir!	LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.	Why she got a chain on her?
Get me the Radio Tower!	Put it down!
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.	Are you getting tired?
It's...it's...all right.	Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.	Welcome home, John.
I want to drive awhile.	I ain't tired yet.
Do you have your own cell?	No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?	He's out.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?	You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
Go ahead.	You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.	Let's have a toast.
What the hell are you doing?	I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.
Uh-uh.	Are you feeling okay?
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.	If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Good-bye, darling.	Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.	You take her to a doctor?
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.	I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Hell of a war.	I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --	"Say there's just one ""mole"" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?"
This has to happen fast.	I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Do you know?	No.
Just be yourself.	Always good advice.
Wait for Kumar.	Come on, Kumar.
What's wrong with me?	Your distraught.  It'll help...
You look a little tired.	I'm okay. It's going well!
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.	I'd never get an abortion.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.	I'll call it... tails.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?	Hardly.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...	You can't keep being his father...
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!	Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.	True.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?	No thanks, Carl.
I know, just let me sleep	What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?	Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.	I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.	Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Oh, I'd love to.	Okay, this is one of my favorites.
How are you doing?	Not too good.
Let's go.	Longitude 109 --
It's all about the money, isn't it?	Isn't it always?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.	If you get it?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.	Dignan, I --
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.	No, did you use a condom?
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.	I must... consult with my father.
... Into a monk...	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
I guess I'll see you sometime.	I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.	I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.	Okay, There's more, Stan --
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.	Be right down.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
What?	You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
Who can we trust?	There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.	Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
It's my Bullworker.	Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?	You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --	Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.	It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.	This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Really?	I hope I'm not being too forward.
How was...  ...the ballet?	It was the experience of a lifetime.
Does it float?	We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.	I have no proof that it was false data.
Father -	Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Great, yes, I'd like that.	And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.	Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
Sorry.	What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Since my little girl became a mom...	You disappointed in me?
Where's he gone?	He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
"Simple. Just say, ""Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'."" There. Easy as pie."	Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...	Yes.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.	Originals?
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.	You love her that much?
Hi, honey!	Hi.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?	Yeah. How's Dad?
He never showed it.	He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Look at you, you skinny prick.	You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
What is that?	What, sir?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.	Hi.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.	What's up?
Habib?	My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!	I don't know --
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?	Regret.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...	You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
The key!	Where is it? What did you do with it?
Could we talk about that a little later?	Of course.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.	Your father is proud of you.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!	Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
No kidding?	No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!	My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?	Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...	My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
I'm okay. It's going well!	'Have a look?
Thank you, sir.	I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes!	Well, don't do that again!
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.	Thank you.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.	Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.	You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
"The technical term for you is ""chimera""..."	Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.	We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.	How come I never hearda you before?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.	I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.	Patrick?
If we still have one.	Yes...
I hope it's not the oven again.	Yeah.
Yes.	We'll stop then.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.	Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Why? Why do you have to go?	My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?	Longevity is classified.  No.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.	Whatever.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.	I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.	Women!
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.	Alright. How much you need, ho?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.	Do you own a car?
Yes. That's kind of how it was.	Uh-huh.
Thank you very much.	My pleasure.
Touch of the flu.	I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.	You drink whiskey?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.	You are a fanatic.
Do you know what happened to her?	I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
How well did you know him?	I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.	I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.	It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.	I don't understand, who are... ?
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!	For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.	Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Uh, I think they have.	Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
What?	What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
CONTINUED	Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?	I see a car.
What guy?	Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!	Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
What does Charlie mean?	Hey, all right.
Call me Tom.	Alright, Tom.
How'd you get the job?	Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
That's a sharp jacket.	Thanks.
You don't even know his name.	Yes, I do.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.	Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Wow	Let's go.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.	No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.	Bull.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.	Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --	You can trust me.
Have you pulled yourself together?	...Not yet.
I am the Princess of Wales.	Wife of Edward, the king's son?
No...	He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
I figured you already heard.	Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
What? What are you doing?	What are you doing here?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.	Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.	Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?	Thank you.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.	Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
What?	Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Well, how d'you think I feel?	The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.	It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
I don't know.	If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
We're moving through time.	What?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.	Gots no intention of ending up broke.
-- who? -- who else is here? --	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Vodka.	Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Yes, sir.	Mine too?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.	It's Bullwinkle.
What?	We had an argument. He's being silly.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?	No offense.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.	Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Don't you remember?	I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.	You'll call me, right?
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?	I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --	No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
My God, Austin, what have you done?	That's not your mother, that's a man!
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.	Why wasn't I insulted?
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.	That's great.
You're really serious, aren't you?	Yes, I am.
Hi.	Hi.
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?	Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.	You want me to come out there and play private eye?
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.	What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.	How is he - ?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.	We can't be.
Talk English Doc.	This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.	I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Who?	BIANCA
Just wondering.	I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
There ya go.	Good, let's drink up.
Where does he sell it?	Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.	You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The Duke?  What did you do?	This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.	I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I don't think I want to hear this --	Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.	Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Position?	Can't lock up...
Umm, that also has already happened.	Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.	No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.	Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Save it for Bourne.	What?
What took you so long?	I just walked in.
I don't like it.	Why not?
But not to last.	Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
What are they doing?	Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.	Is he... dying then?
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.	It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.	We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.	I didn't start this, R.L.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.	What are you sorry for?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.	Damn.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.	If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--	More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
No.	Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Ahhhhhhhhh!	Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
"Have you ever heard the saying, ""He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"""	Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
What did you find out, Mike?	I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?	Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?	That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.	Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Sir -	Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.	Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.	Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.	That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Beg pardon?	Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
for the rheumatism, you know.	What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
You're not yet three months, are you?	Not yet. What do you know about it?
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.	OK, Dad.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.	Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.	Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Yes, Griff?	All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?	I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.	It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.	I despise the job.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?	Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.	Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Help you?	Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Terrible boring.	What else is new? Right?
Rolfe.	A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
So, what do I say?	"Simple. Just say, ""Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'."" There. Easy as pie."
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?	Somewhere down there?
I don't guess.	Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
Steed	How did you guess?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?	Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Can't I just go with you guys?	Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Yes I did.	Fine. How's everything going?
Adam?!	I'm sorry.
Yes, indeed.	And German?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?	Did you say formal? I must dress.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.	DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?	Just smack her now.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.	Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --	No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.	It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
The red hair... It's bad luck.	It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.	That's a lotta crap.
My career is shot.	Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Yeah.	I'm sorry about what I said.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.	Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?	Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.	You think they sold me out? No way.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.	It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
But	You always been this selfish?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?	I do.
What is this, a game?	I want to hear it from you.
I think you better put him on ice, man.	He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Okay, thanks.	I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.	I'll risk it.
The guy with the underpants!	That's boring!
Really!	NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.	Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.	I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Really?	Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
What happened?	Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.	You hated West more than any of us.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.	This isn't a game.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!	We went to a hotel.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?	True.
You will give us the names?	"If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more ""persuasive methods"" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now."
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.	I agree, Baron.
Yes sir.	Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?	No.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.	But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.	It truly is.
How was Russia?	Cold.
It was the experience of a lifetime.	How `bout a hug for the old man.
Do they let you --	I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.	The standard ten.
I don't know.	Proceed inside.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Regardless, he still is your father.	It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
What'd you do?	Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.	Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.	Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.	Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
A hundred bucks a date.	Forget it.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?	All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
The Feds would be onto you in a month.	Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?	There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You got a name, cop?	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Yes.	The hospital?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.	Glass?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?	Apparently he has the letters.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?	I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?	Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --	Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.	My brother blacksmiths!
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.	Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?	Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?	Let's do him right here.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.	-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
You're all under arrest. Open up!	Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
He go back to the hotel?	Uh..he might of.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.	You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?	Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Know what we need, man?... some rope.	For what?
Does this assignment interest you?	Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
I'll tell him when he comes in.	Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
...What?	I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Let's see...  That you were with-	Well, I could he wrong.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.	You promise?
Huh?	I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?	Yeah, but.
Hey, you know what I really think?	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?	It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I should probably write that down.	Yeah.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?	Scared. We're scared.
How much?	First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
Not a good time to lose one's head.	Indeed.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.	Are you going to have women at your party?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!	Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.	I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
This is no game.	I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
Jeffrey?	Yes?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?	I didn't care about the money.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?	We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.	I want you to meet some people.
I told them to fall back...	They're but off!  Do something!
Emil???!	Surprise!  Surprise!
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...	What's wrong?  Are you alright?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.	Conklin up front.
What?	Fight. You know.
Yeah... well...	You will wait?
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?	I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I'm sorry, Dude, butI	That don't do us any good.
How did you know I was here?	I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?	Man, I don't want to go into this.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.	Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.	You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Do you think they'll go along with us?	Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.	Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!	Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
What does that mean for Evan?	He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Are you alright?	Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Huh?	And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!	I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
Maybe another time.	I'll take you up on that.
How ya doing, honey?	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.	So you can't tell me anything?
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.	Can't make enough swords!
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.	And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.	But you were punished.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.	I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.	You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
"""..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."""	Amen..
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.	I'm sure you would.
Be careful.	Thanks.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?	No. You sure you're okay?
You have my word.  As a gentleman	You're sweet.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?	Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Not a big music fan, eh?	No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
That's true.	Thank you very much, Hal.
Now, where we goin', convict?	Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Stop it!	I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.	Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
I know.	You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You're not a big talker, are you?	Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.	What do you mean?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?	If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I want to buy a car.	How can anyone be that naive?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.	Wallace's followers.
"The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. ""Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."""	Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
And why would I do that?	Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.	I can't wait.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?	Homey.
Viceroy of the West Indies.	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Not like Matt, you mean.	"Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? ""I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission."" The shit!"
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!	My son, no one can speak for God.
Exactly. A dance.	But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.	Thank you for accepting.
We all did.	Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Or what? OR WHAT?	Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
She just seemed... depressed... ?	She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.	Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.	My mother's told me all about you.
And old ladies?	-- Burn them.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.	I'm not even going to dignify that --
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.	That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
Okay?	Mm-hm.
Like amnesia.	Can't remember shit. CRS.
Minus one.	You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
David, don't lose control.	Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
Back off, George.	But I-- .
...aconite get it dat cheap.	I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!	Tempus fugit!
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.	The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.	Where?  Show me where.
You don't say. How real does it feel?	As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.	I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?	I didn't --
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!	I forgive you.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.	You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?	Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Yep.	"Why aren't we the ""Younger-James Gang""? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here."
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?	Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
We got -- I don't know, we got separated	Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.	There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
So how's Tommy?	They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.	Don't know if God wanna see me.
No, really. I'm okay.	You sure? I can always get you a lime.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.	Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Who are these people?	My Mom and Dad.
Come on!	I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
No.	Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear	Right.
Please.	If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.	What?
For how long?	Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
What happened to your pants?	Mom, meet Jango.
Sir?	What is that?
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.	So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Are you expecting anyone?	I wasn't expecting you.
Global warming?	Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.	Shakespeare.  He's European.
Not at all.	I just though you were awful cute.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.	Yes.  That follows.
No brag. Just fact.	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?	"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"
How hot are they?	Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...	Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.	Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.	That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.	And you'd never been there before?
You want to share it?	Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?	Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?	I am, Your Eminence
Out there.	No way.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.	They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
What's this?	You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
He needs me, ma'am.	No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
You're making me very angry.	Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.	It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!	I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
She's really kind of hot.	She's an attractive older woman.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --	I better do this, Stan.
Yes, ma'am!	Stop that ma'am crap!
Me neither.	Let the law --
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.	What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?	That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?	Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.	Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Where's Mother?	Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.	Thank you.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.	I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.	We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
The coward!	He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.	Huh?
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!	Don't let that worry you, Annette!
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?	Yeah.
Hold on!	Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?	Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?	This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?	Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
You mean, while I'm here.	I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.	If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Right. Okay. Moving on.	You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
You give me ulcers.	That's my job.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.	We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.	A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
He said to follow him.	Follow him where?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?	But the line has to be drawn.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?	Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Wasn't it, Keitel?	Well... I... I thought...
I work for city hall.	Really? No kidding.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.	Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
What do you think?	But how could he know... unless...
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.	Swayzak's not my boss.
Stand up.	No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Yes.	And that's it?
Got to follow the paper path here.	Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.	Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.	No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Nothin' too showy!	Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.	He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
Why not?	Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't know who that is.	What's going on in Berlin?
The point is, they want a man inside.	And I thought you were a bright woman.
I do alright.	Good!
Shit. The last time I saw you.	Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
It was my decision, not his.	Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
You're. Acting. Like your father.	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Who, Father?	Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Ouch.	Sorry.
What?	Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
The ambulance guys lugged him up.	You stayed away?
Righteousness for his namesake.	"Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say ""May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm."" And you will say..."
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?	He's rich.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.	You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
What are you... ?	Take out your gun!
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.	I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.	How awful for John.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.	But you don't look very happy.
What did I say?	I told you he's crazy.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.	Any of 'em any good?
But if you'll just give me...	It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Where does he work?	In there, sir.
Damn!	They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Tammy Curry?	Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Are you wasted?	No. I just got a messed up stomach.
I don't know.	I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.	Eight-fifty.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.	What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.	Certainly, Herr Director.
What?	The new star. What are you gonna name it?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?	No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Dammit!	A trap.
You told me to change my hair!	What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.	Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.	Yeah.
I knew you'd come.	Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
That he was.	They're making him a hero now.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.	Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
I hope it's nothing serious.	Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
How?	"Say we bust into a bank. We yell ""We're the Younger-James Gang!"" People are gonna be thinking, ""The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?"" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms."
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.	Well, these things take time.
Negative.	That's not possible.
We can't just sit here, Austin.	Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
"Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all ""re-enter"" the concerto. Voila!"	Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.	Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
I'm listening.	As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.	Is he going to be okay?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?	I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Nice guy. Who's he?	Who's it, you mean.
No I don't.  She worries about you.	Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Or sometimes not at all.	Care for some saki?
Like he meant it.	Yeah.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.	I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
What's the question?	Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?	You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
What?	You were talking in your sleep.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.	Cheese is particularly troublesome.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.	You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Thank you, Exposition.	Oh, and Austin...
What's this?	My apartment.
I never had a really real pair before.	You've never had any formal training, either?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?	That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Just...say...no.	Just say no?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.	Is she not here?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.	Yes, sir, I am.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.	I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.	I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Okay, til tonight.	Tonight.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?	Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
You like to open me, don't you?	Yes.
Hello?	Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
What?	Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
A what?	It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --	Watch me.
I have five-hundred dollars.	Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Call me please, Patrick.	Jesus lives, Luis.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...	What's lucky about that?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.	Do you love him?
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?	Yes, something.
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
Gary, hi.	You look a little tired.
Hello. You all right?	I'm sorry I woke you up.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.	They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!	You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!	That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.	That's the plan.  My word on it.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?	We were both seven in 1969.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?	Who's doing this?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...	What do you know of my husband?
I won't be staying.	I'm not a half bad cook.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!	Oh my son, my poor son!
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?	I thought you played by the rules.
My mother's told me all about you.	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Am I a doctor, no, but...	Are you an expert in amnesia?
Jack.	David.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
He was a year ahead of us?	He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.	...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!	Get away from me!!
The fuck are you talking about --	You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.	"The technical term for you is ""chimera""..."
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.	No, you do it. I can't sing.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!	All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Stop it, Jack.	Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
"Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the ""Physical Fitness"" routine..."	Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.

We were both seven in 1969.	So was I.
Very funny, smart ass.	Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!

I was?	That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Oh, ten dollars	Yes.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?	Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
I heard there was a poetry reading.	You 're so --
I just though you were awful cute.	Thank you, Miss -- ?
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.	That is a trifle strong.
That's a lotta crap.	Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Blow me.	What did you say?
What else can we do?	Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..	Yes. Of course..
I am so ashamed.	What for?
That is the most unprofessional --	Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
26 weeks.	And what does that cover?
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.	I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?	You're crazy.
